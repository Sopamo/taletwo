Salt mist threaded the sconces, turning the candle flames into wavering petals. Hermione moved quiet as a thought, palm skimming the carved banister, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum.\n\nThe Dean’s door stood half-ajar, a single witchlight breathing over ledger-stacks and a decanter beaded with condensation. The office smelled of beeswax, ink, and distant rain. Maps of sea-floor trenches hung like veils, their sigils stitched in silver thread.\n\n“Dr. Granger,” Dean Morwen said without looking up. Her sleeves were rolled, rings dark with ink, throat bare above the high collar. That voice, low and resonant, struck along Hermione’s nerves like a bow on string. “After-hours visits are… irregular.”\n\n“I prefer the hours when people are honest,” Hermione said, stepping in and closing the door with a soft latch. The storm boomed somewhere below the cliff, and the glass decanter chimed. She could feel the pull in her belly, the urge to sink, to serve, to coax sound from that composed mouth. She breathed it in, steadying, letting want sharpen to purpose.\n\nMorwen watched her with calm, assessing eyes. “You want something from the Arcanum that it does not give freely.” Her fingertips rested on a folio embossed with a drowned crest. “And you’re very used to getting what you want.”\n\n“I want to listen where others have forbidden listening,” Hermione said. “I want the tides that speak under the floorboards, the stacks that never make the catalogues. I want the sea to trust me with its words.” Her hand brushed the edge of the desk; her knuckles skimmed a cool ring. Heat ran through her at the simple contact, the suggestion of permission and restraint.\n\nMorwen’s mouth curved, almost not a smile. “The Siren schools are proscribed for reasons beyond piety. They unmake discipline. They make people… sing.” The pause tipped the room toward confession. The Dean poured two fingers of clear spirit. She held one glass out; their fingers met, slick with condensation, the touch small and devastating.\n\nHermione lifted the glass, the spirit sharp as lightning on her tongue. “Discipline can hold a song without breaking,” she said, voice soft. The storm crooned in the chimney. She stepped closer, close enough to smell salt on Morwen’s skin, ink on her wrist. “Let me prove it to you.” The words hung between them, heavy with promise and not-quite-touched breath, while the witchlight trembled and the sea kept time below.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Hermione stepped back into the corridor, pulse loud in her ears, the Siren fragment hot against her skin like a secret tongue.\n\nA man waited in the shadow of a spine-arch, cloak the blue of hammered stormlight, hair damp and curling at his nape. “Dr. Granger,” he said, voice all wind and salt.

She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist. There’s an annex below the geology rooms. If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain.

Salt mist threaded the sconces, turning the candle flames into wavering petals. Hermione moved quiet as a thought, palm skimming the carved banister, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum.\n\nThe Dean’s door stood half-ajar, a single witchlight breathing over ledger-stacks and a decanter beaded with condensation. The office smelled of beeswax, ink, and distant rain. Maps of sea-floor trenches hung like veils, their sigils stitched in silver thread.\n\n“Dr. Granger,” Dean Morwen said without looking up. Her sleeves were rolled, rings dark with ink, throat bare above the high collar. That voice, low and resonant, struck along Hermione’s nerves like a bow on string. “After-hours visits are… irregular.”\n\n“I prefer the hours when people are honest,” Hermione said, stepping in and closing the door with a soft latch. The storm boomed somewhere below the cliff, and the glass decanter chimed. She could feel the pull in her belly, the urge to sink, to serve, to coax sound from that composed mouth. She breathed it in, steadying, letting want sharpen to purpose.\n\nMorwen watched her with calm, assessing eyes. “You want something from the Arcanum that it does not give freely.” Her fingertips rested on a folio embossed with a drowned crest. “And you’re very used to getting what you want.”\n\n“I want to listen where others have forbidden listening,” Hermione said. “I want the tides that speak under the floorboards, the stacks that never make the catalogues. I want the sea to trust me with its words.” Her hand brushed the edge of the desk; her knuckles skimmed a cool ring. Heat ran through her at the simple contact, the suggestion of permission and restraint.\n\nMorwen’s mouth curved, almost not a smile. “The Siren schools are proscribed for reasons beyond piety. They unmake discipline. They make people… sing.” The pause tipped the room toward confession. The Dean poured two fingers of clear spirit. She held one glass out; their fingers met, slick with condensation, the touch small and devastating.\n\nHermione lifted the glass, the spirit sharp as lightning on her tongue. “Discipline can hold a song without breaking,” she said, voice soft. The storm crooned in the chimney. She stepped closer, close enough to smell salt on Morwen’s skin, ink on her wrist. “Let me prove it to you.” The words hung between them, heavy with promise and not-quite-touched breath, while the witchlight trembled and the sea kept time below.\n-- Page 3 --\nMorwen’s glass kissed the desk with a soft click. “Prove it without breaking anything,” she said, and dismissed her with a look that was almost a touch. Hermione stepped back into the corridor, pulse loud in her ears, the Siren fragment hot against her skin like a secret tongue.\n\nA man waited in the shadow of a spine-arch, cloak the blue of hammered stormlight, hair damp and curling at his nape. “Dr. Granger,” he said, voice all wind and salt. He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist. There’s an annex below the geology rooms. If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers. The smell of it rose—grease, salt, old ink. She slid it free. The case’s wards brushed her wrists like cold tongues and withdrew.\n\nAs she stood, the sea boomed through the cliff. She tucked the folio under her cloak, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum, and let her fingers trail briefly over the gatewarden’s belt as she passed, a graze that lifted him onto his toes. “I’ll return it before dawn,” she said, voice low and sure. Her thighs ached with restraint as she stepped back into the corridor where the sconces hissed with damp and the storm wrote its hard, steady love against the stone.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh.

The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound.

Hermione stepped back into the corridor, pulse loud in her ears, the Siren fragment hot against her skin like a secret tongue.\n\nA man waited in the shadow of a spine-arch, cloak the blue of hammered stormlight, hair damp and curling at his nape. “Dr. Granger,” he said, voice all wind and salt. He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist. There’s an annex below the geology rooms. If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex. The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings.

Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex. The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers. The smell of it rose—grease, salt, old ink. She slid it free. The case’s wards brushed her wrists like cold tongues and withdrew.\n\nAs she stood, the sea boomed through the cliff. She tucked the folio under her cloak, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum, and let her fingers trail briefly over the gatewarden’s belt as she passed, a graze that lifted him onto his toes. “I’ll return it before dawn,” she said, voice low and sure. Her thighs ached with restraint as she stepped back into the corridor where the sconces hissed with damp and the storm wrote its hard, steady love against the stone.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Hermione stepped back into the corridor, pulse loud in her ears, the Siren fragment hot against her skin like a secret tongue.\n\nA man waited in the shadow of a spine-arch, cloak the blue of hammered stormlight, hair damp and curling at his nape. “Dr. Granger,” he said, voice all wind and salt. He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist. There’s an annex below the geology rooms. If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them.

Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex. The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers. The smell of it rose—grease, salt, old ink. She slid it free. The case’s wards brushed her wrists like cold tongues and withdrew.\n\nAs she stood, the sea boomed through the cliff. She tucked the folio under her cloak, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum, and let her fingers trail briefly over the gatewarden’s belt as she passed, a graze that lifted him onto his toes. “I’ll return it before dawn,” she said, voice low and sure. Her thighs ached with restraint as she stepped back into the corridor where the sconces hissed with damp and the storm wrote its hard, steady love against the stone.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist.

Hermione stepped back into the corridor, pulse loud in her ears, the Siren fragment hot against her skin like a secret tongue.\n\nA man waited in the shadow of a spine-arch, cloak the blue of hammered stormlight, hair damp and curling at his nape. “Dr. Granger,” he said, voice all wind and salt. He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist. There’s an annex below the geology rooms. If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex. The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers. The smell of it rose—grease, salt, old ink. She slid it free. The case’s wards brushed her wrists like cold tongues and withdrew.\n\nAs she stood, the sea boomed through the cliff. She tucked the folio under her cloak, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum, and let her fingers trail briefly over the gatewarden’s belt as she passed, a graze that lifted him onto his toes. “I’ll return it before dawn,” she said, voice low and sure. Her thighs ached with restraint as she stepped back into the corridor where the sconces hissed with damp and the storm wrote its hard, steady love against the stone.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Hermione stepped back into the corridor, pulse loud in her ears, the Siren fragment hot against her skin like a secret tongue.\n\nA man waited in the shadow of a spine-arch, cloak the blue of hammered stormlight, hair damp and curling at his nape. “Dr. Granger,” he said, voice all wind and salt. He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist. There’s an annex below the geology rooms. If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex. The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers.

The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers. The smell of it rose—grease, salt, old ink. She slid it free. The case’s wards brushed her wrists like cold tongues and withdrew.\n\nAs she stood, the sea boomed through the cliff. She tucked the folio under her cloak, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum, and let her fingers trail briefly over the gatewarden’s belt as she passed, a graze that lifted him onto his toes. “I’ll return it before dawn,” she said, voice low and sure. Her thighs ached with restraint as she stepped back into the corridor where the sconces hissed with damp and the storm wrote its hard, steady love against the stone.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Hermione stepped back into the corridor, pulse loud in her ears, the Siren fragment hot against her skin like a secret tongue.\n\nA man waited in the shadow of a spine-arch, cloak the blue of hammered stormlight, hair damp and curling at his nape. “Dr. Granger,” he said, voice all wind and salt. He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist. There’s an annex below the geology rooms. If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex.

She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex. The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers. The smell of it rose—grease, salt, old ink. She slid it free. The case’s wards brushed her wrists like cold tongues and withdrew.\n\nAs she stood, the sea boomed through the cliff. She tucked the folio under her cloak, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum, and let her fingers trail briefly over the gatewarden’s belt as she passed, a graze that lifted him onto his toes. “I’ll return it before dawn,” she said, voice low and sure. Her thighs ached with restraint as she stepped back into the corridor where the sconces hissed with damp and the storm wrote its hard, steady love against the stone.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Hermione stepped back into the corridor, pulse loud in her ears, the Siren fragment hot against her skin like a secret tongue.\n\nA man waited in the shadow of a spine-arch, cloak the blue of hammered stormlight, hair damp and curling at his nape. “Dr. Granger,” he said, voice all wind and salt. He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist. There’s an annex below the geology rooms. If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone.

If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex. The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers. The smell of it rose—grease, salt, old ink. She slid it free. The case’s wards brushed her wrists like cold tongues and withdrew.\n\nAs she stood, the sea boomed through the cliff. She tucked the folio under her cloak, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum, and let her fingers trail briefly over the gatewarden’s belt as she passed, a graze that lifted him onto his toes. “I’ll return it before dawn,” she said, voice low and sure. Her thighs ached with restraint as she stepped back into the corridor where the sconces hissed with damp and the storm wrote its hard, steady love against the stone.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise.

Hermione stepped back into the corridor, pulse loud in her ears, the Siren fragment hot against her skin like a secret tongue.\n\nA man waited in the shadow of a spine-arch, cloak the blue of hammered stormlight, hair damp and curling at his nape. “Dr. Granger,” he said, voice all wind and salt. He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist. There’s an annex below the geology rooms. If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex. The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers. The smell of it rose—grease, salt, old ink. She slid it free. The case’s wards brushed her wrists like cold tongues and withdrew.\n\nAs she stood, the sea boomed through the cliff. She tucked the folio under her cloak, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum, and let her fingers trail briefly over the gatewarden’s belt as she passed, a graze that lifted him onto his toes. “I’ll return it before dawn,” she said, voice low and sure. Her thighs ached with restraint as she stepped back into the corridor where the sconces hissed with damp and the storm wrote its hard, steady love against the stone.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Hermione stepped back into the corridor, pulse loud in her ears, the Siren fragment hot against her skin like a secret tongue.\n\nA man waited in the shadow of a spine-arch, cloak the blue of hammered stormlight, hair damp and curling at his nape. “Dr. Granger,” he said, voice all wind and salt. He bowed like someone used to command. “Sir Kael Rime. Tempest House.” His gloved hand lifted hers, thumb finding the inside of her wrist. The slow pressure made her knees soften. “We keep a private salon on the east turret. Low music, higher winds. Come by tomorrow after last bell. We look after friends.”\n\nHe stepped closer, the archway wrapping them in dark and drip. She smelled rain and steel and something male and clean, and her mouth watered. She wanted to sink, to open him, to lick the brine from the head of him until his disciplined stance shook. Her fingers had already found his belt when a lantern bobbed around the bend. Kael caught her hand and pressed it flat to the stone, breath ghosting her ear. “Not here,” he murmured, wicked. “Earn your storms in a room with a lock.” He slid a storm-blue card into her bodice, knuckles grazing the curve of her breast, then smiled and was gone, boots quiet on wet tile.\n\nShe stood a moment, throbbing with denial and promise. The lantern bearer—a prefect—passed, eyes down. Hermione exhaled, then licked the pad of her thumb, savoring the ghost of Kael’s skin, and moved on, heat pooling low and steady.\n\nThe library stacks were a hush of vellum and salt-cold air. A woman in black waited where the aisle narrowed, hair braided tight, collar severe, an obsidian shard pinned over her sternum. “Sable Kade,” she said, unobtrusive as a blade. “Obsidian House.” Her gaze tracked Hermione’s mouth with clinical hunger. “We curate the things the Dean prefers to pretend don’t exist. There’s an annex below the geology rooms. If you want to read where the sea keeps its teeth, come when the bells ring for matins.”\n\nSable stepped into her space, one hand lifting to her hair, not quite touching. “You have a gift for tongues,” she said. “It would be a shame to waste it on silence.” Hermione leaned, wanting that hand to grip and guide her down. She pictured opening Sable under the reading desk, tongue working until that composed voice frayed to a broken whisper. Sable’s smile sharpened as if she felt the thought; she tucked a black-edged card under Hermione’s garter, fingers deliberate, heat sparking where they brushed thigh.\n\n“Bring nothing but your mouth,” Sable murmured, then let her pass, the smell of ink and crushed cedar trailing after her. Hermione’s steps were light, hungry. She had two doors, two storms, two promises.\n\nBack in her room, she set the blue and the black on the sill. The glass wept rain. She spread her knees on the mattress, slid her skirt up, and murmured the lowest siren vowel against her own wrist. It vibrated through bone. She sank two fingers and rode the pulse, thinking of Kael’s grip and Sable’s cool order, of mouths opening, of favors paid in private rooms with thick locks and the sea pounding approval into the cliff below.\n-- Page 4 --\nMatins bells shivered the stones. Hermione tightened the laces of her bodice with neat fingers, breath slow, thighs still tender from the night’s self-indulgence. The Siren fragment lay warm against her breastbone, a secret pulse she matched with her own.\n\nThe geology corridor smelled of damp chalk and iron. She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex. The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath. She let the shard kiss the seam of the lock. The wards prickled over her skin, a static that lifted the hairs on her arms. Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers.

Desire pooled low and heavy; she swallowed it and smiled. “And a steady hand.”\n\nHe hovered as she sank to her knees to better see the clasp, the cold stone biting through her stockings. She could feel his body heat above, the outline of him gathering against cloth. Her mouth watered with the same sharp want that had driven her into Sable’s thigh. She leaned forward until her breath fogged the ward-script, lips brushing air just above the clasp. “Hush for me,” she whispered to the lock, and let the barest hint of the lowest vowel purl against the seal—caged, careful, leashed like a fighting dog on a silk lead.\n\nThe red wax shivered and parted with a sticky sigh. The gatewarden exhaled, a small, helpless sound. Hermione tilted her head, cheek grazing the inside of his knee as she reached, just because she could, savoring the flinch and the way his fingers tightened on the edge of the desk. “Later,” she murmured without looking up, a promise and a reprieve, and lifted the lid.\n\nInside lay a folio bound in sharkskin, edges stamped with ward-iron, corners tagged with Obsidian’s quiet sigil and the Dean’s severe hand in the margin: counter-chant schema, harmonic abatement, siren dampers. The smell of it rose—grease, salt, old ink. She slid it free. The case’s wards brushed her wrists like cold tongues and withdrew.\n\nAs she stood, the sea boomed through the cliff. She tucked the folio under her cloak, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum, and let her fingers trail briefly over the gatewarden’s belt as she passed, a graze that lifted him onto his toes. “I’ll return it before dawn,” she said, voice low and sure. Her thighs ached with restraint as she stepped back into the corridor where the sconces hissed with damp and the storm wrote its hard, steady love against the stone.\n-- Page 6 --\nThe corridor breathed damp against her cheeks as she slipped from the annex, folio tight under her cloak. The fragment at her breast thrummed, picking up the sea’s hammer and turning it sweet. Heat spread through her skin like a tide; eyes followed her, bodies leaned. Her want wanted to spill.\n\nShe stopped in an alcove where salt dripped from a cracked cornice. She pressed two fingers to her throat and traced a neat sigil in spit and breath, a soft syllable that rang like a struck glass. The air clicked. Her pulse steadied as the charm knit: nothing but explicit yes would cross her mouth tonight, and nothing would stick that wasn’t chosen.\n\nThe surge dulled to a bright edge she could wield. Footsteps slowed as they neared, then moved on, the charm sorting appetite from consent with a cool, approving hand. She smiled, wet-lipped, and went down the slate stair to Obsidian’s door.\n\nSable was waiting by the same lamp, collar straight, hair pinned. Hermione slid the sharkskin folio onto the bench. “As asked,” she said, voice low. Sable’s gaze flicked past it to Hermione’s mouth, then lower, to the faint gleam at her throat.\n\n“New ward?” Sable murmured, fingers hovering just shy of the sigil. Hermione leaned into the almost-touch and held Sable’s eyes.\n\n“My terms,” she said. “No exclusivity. You ask; I say yes or no. Same for Tempest. Same for the gatewarden if I take pity on him. We make it explicit, every time.” Her hand closed over Sable’s wrist, a soft pin, not a trap. “Say it for me.”\n\nSable’s nostrils flared; the corner of her mouth curved. “Yes,” she said, crisp. “No exclusivity. Explicit opt-ins. Say it back.” Hermione’s smile sharpened; she felt the charm hum in pleased affirmation.\n\n“Yes,” she purred. “On my knees when asked and when I want it. Tonight I want it.” She sank, skirts whispering, then paused, breath warm against silk. She waited, throat bright with the ward’s cool kiss, until Sable’s hand settled in her hair and the answer came, clear and chosen: “Yes.”\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

She found the black-edged sigil hidden in a seam of slate and pressed. A lock unlatched with a whisper like a slit throat exhaling. Stairs spiraled down, slick with condensed breath from the cliff.\n\nSable Kade waited by a workbench lit with a single lamp. Coat off, sleeves rolled, throat pale above the severe collar, she looked like a problem sharpened to a line. “You came empty-handed,” she said, gaze dropping to Hermione’s lips. “Good.”\n\nHermione stepped close, her mouth already watering. “I came ready,” she murmured, and sank to her knees on cold stone. The chill steadied her. She inhaled Sable’s scent—ink, cedar, clean skin—and pressed her cheek to a stockinged thigh, a small nuzzle that felt like a promise she’d kept.\n\nSable’s hand slid into her hair, firm. “Show me your discipline,” she said. Hermione bared Sable with deft fingers, kissed the soft heat, then opened her with a slow, reverent lick. The first taste was salt-sweet and precise as a datum. She moaned into it, quiet and greedy, tongue flattening, tip circling, jaw working until Sable’s composure tightened above her.\n\nShe hummed the lowest siren vowel against Sable’s clit—just a breath of it, careful—and the sound vibrated through both of them. Sable’s hips jerked. “Clever,” she hissed, fingers tightening, tugging Hermione closer. Hermione smiled against flesh and licked harder, faster, cheeks wet, nose pressed deep, swallowing every shiver. The hand in her hair guided her rhythm, and she surrendered to it, mouth relentless, throat open to the spill of breath and sound and power.\n\nSable broke with a muffled cry, knuckles white on the edge of the bench, thighs tightening around Hermione’s ears. Hermione didn’t stop; she gentled the aftershocks with soft laps, planting kisses like signatures, savoring the taste until Sable’s breathing evened and her grip eased to a stroke.\n\n“Useful tongue,” Sable said at last, voice husky at the edges. She crouched and hooked a finger under Hermione’s chin, eyes cool and approving. From her pocket she produced a shard of black glass etched with runes. “This opens a case in the drowned-language annex. A folio on harmonic countermeasures—red-stamped, unshelved. Bring it to me tonight. And keep that song between your teeth unless I ask.” Hermione kissed the inside of Sable’s wrist in answer, tasting salt and steel, and rose with her hunger sharpened to a bright, obedient point.\n-- Page 5 --\nRain ticked the high windows as Hermione slipped into the drowned-language annex. The air was cooler here, tinged with copper and brine, the quiet held taut by wards that clicked like distant beetles. Lantern glass wore a film of salt; shelves leaned with vellum swollen from years of fog.\n\nShe palmed the shard Sable had given her. The runes caught witchlight and threw a thin, oily sheen across her fingers. At the back, a low case of stormglass waited, its lid stitched in sealing script, a red wax sigil sunk like a blood moon at its clasp.\n\n“Evening, Doctor.” The gatewarden unfolded from a reading stool, big hands, rain-dark hair, eyes that slid to her mouth and stayed. His badge hummed at his lapel, chiming a polite warning. “Red-stamp is restricted.” His voice softened on the last word, betraying him.\n\n“I have the right key,” she said, stepping close enough to smell wet wool and cardamom tea on his breath.

The smell of it rose—grease, salt, old ink. She slid it free. The case’s wards brushed her wrists like cold tongues and withdrew.\n\nAs she stood, the sea boomed through the cliff. She tucked the folio under her cloak, the Siren fragment warm against her sternum, and let her fingers trail briefly over the gatewarden’s belt as she passed, a graze that lifted him onto his toes. “I’ll return it before dawn,” she said, voice low and sure.

She pressed two fingers to her throat and traced a neat sigil in spit and breath, a soft syllable that rang like a struck glass. The air clicked. Her pulse steadied as the charm knit: nothing but explicit yes would cross her mouth tonight, and nothing would stick that wasn’t chosen.\n\nThe surge dulled to a bright edge she could wield.

Hermione slid the sharkskin folio onto the bench. “As asked,” she said, voice low.

Sable’s jaw eased, then set again as Hermione circled her clit with a tight, diligent stroke of tongue, sealing the moment with a quiet hum of pleasure in her own throat that didn’t tip into magic.\n\n“May I sing?” Hermione asked, mouth a breath from Sable’s pulse, voice rough with want. The consent charm rang faintly against her tongue. Sable stroked her hair, deliberate. “Yes. The smallest vowel. Keep it leashed.”\n\nHermione anchored her hands and gave that caged note, the lowest thread of sound leashed inside her mouth. It vibrated through Sable’s slick heat into Hermione’s palate, a throaty current that made her thighs tremble. Sable’s breath broke on the intake; she rocked once, then twice, and Hermione followed, rhythm true, nose buried, jaw open, swallowing every twitch, every rivering tremor.\n\n“Good girl,” Sable said, the words clipped and then frayed as Hermione sped the last measures—tongue flick, seal, draw, breathe—until Sable’s composure shattered. The cry she gave was short and strangled; her hand fisted in Hermione’s hair as her thighs locked. Hermione stayed through it, hum going soft to cradle the aftershocks, kissing the wetness she’d drawn out like it was an oath.\n\nWhen Sable eased, Hermione gentled to licks and small kisses, savoring salt and iron and the faint bite of cedar still clinging to skin. She sat back on her heels at last, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, breath warm and steady, eyes bright. Sable crouched to her, thumb brushing a damp corner of Hermione’s lip, gaze steadier now. “Delivered,” Sable murmured, flicking the folio’s edge. “And exemplary follow-through.” The corner of her mouth lifted. “Dean Morwen will notice this folio moved before dawn. If you want her attention, you have it.” Hermione swallowed, heat and anticipation curling together, and kissed Sable’s wrist once more—asking with her mouth. Sable’s answering “Yes,” was quiet and certain, and Hermione smiled, already leaning in again, hungry to make the next promise true.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Sable’s gaze flicked past it to Hermione’s mouth, then lower, to the faint gleam at her throat.\n\n“New ward?” Sable murmured, fingers hovering just shy of the sigil. Hermione leaned into the almost-touch and held Sable’s eyes.\n\n“My terms,” she said. “No exclusivity. You ask; I say yes or no. Same for Tempest. Same for the gatewarden if I take pity on him. We make it explicit, every time.” Her hand closed over Sable’s wrist, a soft pin, not a trap. “Say it for me.”\n\nSable’s nostrils flared; the corner of her mouth curved. “Yes,” she said, crisp. “No exclusivity. Explicit opt-ins. Say it back.” Hermione’s smile sharpened; she felt the charm hum in pleased affirmation.\n\n“Yes,” she purred. “On my knees when asked and when I want it. Tonight I want it.” She sank, skirts whispering, then paused, breath warm against silk. She waited, throat bright with the ward’s cool kiss, until Sable’s hand settled in her hair and the answer came, clear and chosen: “Yes.”\n-- Page 7 --\nHermione’s breath brushed silk; she waited, still as a held chord. Sable’s fingers tightened and then gave a measured pull, guiding her in. The world narrowed to warm scent and the clean line of power in Sable’s posture. Hermione’s mouth curved; she parted fabric and pressed a kiss to bare skin, soft first, then hungry.\n\nShe tasted, slow and methodical, tongue flattening, mapping the slick heat like a scholar tracing a coastline. Sable exhaled a contained sound, boots sliding a whisper on stone. Hermione’s hands bracketed Sable’s hips, thumbs riding the bone, holding her steady as she licked deeper, pressure exact, the way Sable liked her work: precise, unhurried, devastating.\n\n“Look at me,” Sable said, voice low. Hermione tipped her eyes up while her mouth stayed busy, pupils blown, cheeks wet. The gaze held, cool and electric. Sable’s jaw eased, then set again as Hermione circled her clit with a tight, diligent stroke of tongue, sealing the moment with a quiet hum of pleasure in her own throat that didn’t tip into magic.\n\n“May I sing?” Hermione asked, mouth a breath from Sable’s pulse, voice rough with want. The consent charm rang faintly against her tongue. Sable stroked her hair, deliberate. “Yes. The smallest vowel. Keep it leashed.”\n\nHermione anchored her hands and gave that caged note, the lowest thread of sound leashed inside her mouth. It vibrated through Sable’s slick heat into Hermione’s palate, a throaty current that made her thighs tremble. Sable’s breath broke on the intake; she rocked once, then twice, and Hermione followed, rhythm true, nose buried, jaw open, swallowing every twitch, every rivering tremor.\n\n“Good girl,” Sable said, the words clipped and then frayed as Hermione sped the last measures—tongue flick, seal, draw, breathe—until Sable’s composure shattered. The cry she gave was short and strangled; her hand fisted in Hermione’s hair as her thighs locked. Hermione stayed through it, hum going soft to cradle the aftershocks, kissing the wetness she’d drawn out like it was an oath.\n\nWhen Sable eased, Hermione gentled to licks and small kisses, savoring salt and iron and the faint bite of cedar still clinging to skin. She sat back on her heels at last, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, breath warm and steady, eyes bright. Sable crouched to her, thumb brushing a damp corner of Hermione’s lip, gaze steadier now. “Delivered,” Sable murmured, flicking the folio’s edge. “And exemplary follow-through.” The corner of her mouth lifted. “Dean Morwen will notice this folio moved before dawn. If you want her attention, you have it.” Hermione swallowed, heat and anticipation curling together, and kissed Sable’s wrist once more—asking with her mouth. Sable’s answering “Yes,” was quiet and certain, and Hermione smiled, already leaning in again, hungry to make the next promise true.\n-- Page 8 --\nHermione slid back in, mouth open, heat blooming as Sable guided her. The room smelled of rain and sex. Silk scraped her cheek; her tongue found rhythm, patient and greedy at once. Sable’s breath thinned to a blade; the hand in Hermione’s hair steadied, permissive.\n\nShe worked with clean intent—seal, draw, circle, breathe—each stroke a measured offering. The siren fragment at her breast warmed, responding to the salt on her tongue; the want it fed her came back doubled, slick and bright. She moaned into it, careful not to tip the note.\n\nA pressure moved through the stone like a tide turning. Hermione felt it first in her thighs, then in the hinge of her jaw: a pull, coaxing rather than commanding. Wards. Hunger set into the mortar, nudging appetite along its rails. Her pulse caught; her mouth slowed without losing contact.\n\nShe lifted her eyes. “Hold,” she whispered against Sable’s skin. Sable’s fingers flexed. “Holding.” Hermione kept a soft kiss in place and let the sensation pass over her—three beats after each thunder roll, a subtle drag at the base of her spine, a prickle across the lips. It wanted her open, unguarded, spilling.\n\nShe mapped it in her head the way she did glyphs: interval, intensity, decay. Left hand slid to the bench, tracing a quick, private rune on the wood with a wet fingertip, a mnemonic hook. The charm at her throat cooled, filtering the tug into data rather than command. Noted. Filed.\n\nThen she returned to work, renewed by the small victory of naming it. Her tongue pressed and fluttered; she buried her nose and breathed Sable in, greedy and neat. Sable shivered, a low curse escaping, and rolled her hips once in thanks.\n\n“Good,” Hermione murmured, voice husky and sure. “I have you.” She fixed the angle and carried Sable up again, no magic in the sound, only technique, relentless and kind. When Sable tipped, it was with a sharper cry than before, the echo clapping off stone and cloth.\n\nHermione eased her down, licking gentle, then kissed the inside of Sable’s knee. She rose, mouth shining, eyes bright with stormlight and something calculative beneath. “The Arcanum is hungry tonight,” she said softly, almost amused. “I’ll make use of that.” Her fingers tapped her throat-sigil once, satisfied, before smoothing Sable’s skirt back into order.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Hermione let her look and kept her own expression even, one thumb rubbing idle circles against her skirt seam until the urge to grin passed.\n\n“Flinching isn’t in the plan,” Hermione said. The fragment at her breast hummed like a cat trying to be good. She tucked it deeper into the fold of her blouse and rolled one shoulder to settle the weight. The ward-pulse in the stone gave another three-beat tug with the next thunder. She counted it without looking away.\n\nSable’s eyes narrowed in thought. “Tempest is stirring wind to cover something,” she said. “Rime’s boys don’t waste storms. If you’re walking the upper stacks, walk them now.” She stood close enough that the cedar on her skin edged out the damp smell of slate. “And, Granger—keep your mouth honest. It’s working for you.”\n\nHermione’s laugh was quick and low. “It usually does.” She touched two fingers to her throat-sigil in a small salute. “Thank you for the clock.” At the door she paused, the old habit of checking pockets kicking in. Quill, rune slips, mint pastilles, ribbon. The pastilles rattled; she stilled them with a fingertip, soft smile at her own nerves, then slipped into the corridor.\n\nThe stair well was wet-breathed and dim. Torchlight made shallow bowls of shadow on the steps. She trailed a hand along the wall as she climbed, counting beats—roll, one-two-three, pull; roll, one-two-three, prickle—and matching it to her own breathing until the cadence set in bone. She mouthed the interval once, bare vowel, no power; the charm at her throat approved with a faint, cool tingle.\n\nAt the landing she nearly ran into the gatewarden making his rounds, cloak askew, hair damp. He startled, then straightened too fast, hand flying to the badge on his chest. “Miss Granger,” he said, earnest and breathless. Hermione tipped her head, softening her eyes just a fraction. His shoulders eased without him meaning to. “There’s talk of inspection,” he blurted. “Dean Morwen herself. You—ah—you should be in order.”\n\n“In order,” Hermione echoed, amused and gentle. “Thank you.” She let the pause hang precisely long enough for gratitude to sink in, then stepped aside, brushing past with the barest touch of sleeve to sleeve. As she moved on, she tugged a rune slip free and sketched the hunger-ward’s cadence in copper ink, a crisp little knot. The slip warmed in her hand and settled. Another tool. Another angle.\n\nPast the clerestory, the corridor bent toward the upper stacks. The air smelled of old binding glue and ozone. She smoothed her hair, set her mouth in that studious line people trusted, and felt her heartbeat steady to the storm’s math. Tonight, she thought, let Morwen come. I’ll be ready to meet her eyes and make my case.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

She reached to smooth a stray curl from Hermione’s brow, fingers cool, then straightened, composed again. The sharkskin folio clicked softly as she slid it into a locked drawer. Metal found metal with a clean, final note.\n\n“Morwen will pull the ledger,” Sable said, voice back to ledger-calm. “When she comes asking, you won’t flinch.” Her gaze lingered just a heartbeat too long on Hermione’s throat, on the sigil cooling there. Hermione let her look and kept her own expression even, one thumb rubbing idle circles against her skirt seam until the urge to grin passed.\n\n“Flinching isn’t in the plan,” Hermione said. The fragment at her breast hummed like a cat trying to be good. She tucked it deeper into the fold of her blouse and rolled one shoulder to settle the weight. The ward-pulse in the stone gave another three-beat tug with the next thunder. She counted it without looking away.\n\nSable’s eyes narrowed in thought. “Tempest is stirring wind to cover something,” she said. “Rime’s boys don’t waste storms. If you’re walking the upper stacks, walk them now.” She stood close enough that the cedar on her skin edged out the damp smell of slate. “And, Granger—keep your mouth honest. It’s working for you.”\n\nHermione’s laugh was quick and low. “It usually does.” She touched two fingers to her throat-sigil in a small salute. “Thank you for the clock.” At the door she paused, the old habit of checking pockets kicking in. Quill, rune slips, mint pastilles, ribbon. The pastilles rattled; she stilled them with a fingertip, soft smile at her own nerves, then slipped into the corridor.\n\nThe stair well was wet-breathed and dim. Torchlight made shallow bowls of shadow on the steps. She trailed a hand along the wall as she climbed, counting beats—roll, one-two-three, pull; roll, one-two-three, prickle—and matching it to her own breathing until the cadence set in bone. She mouthed the interval once, bare vowel, no power; the charm at her throat approved with a faint, cool tingle.\n\nAt the landing she nearly ran into the gatewarden making his rounds, cloak askew, hair damp. He startled, then straightened too fast, hand flying to the badge on his chest. “Miss Granger,” he said, earnest and breathless. Hermione tipped her head, softening her eyes just a fraction. His shoulders eased without him meaning to. “There’s talk of inspection,” he blurted. “Dean Morwen herself. You—ah—you should be in order.”\n\n“In order,” Hermione echoed, amused and gentle. “Thank you.” She let the pause hang precisely long enough for gratitude to sink in, then stepped aside, brushing past with the barest touch of sleeve to sleeve. As she moved on, she tugged a rune slip free and sketched the hunger-ward’s cadence in copper ink, a crisp little knot. The slip warmed in her hand and settled. Another tool. Another angle.\n\nPast the clerestory, the corridor bent toward the upper stacks. The air smelled of old binding glue and ozone. She smoothed her hair, set her mouth in that studious line people trusted, and felt her heartbeat steady to the storm’s math. Tonight, she thought, let Morwen come. I’ll be ready to meet her eyes and make my case.\n-- Page 10 --\nThe upper stacks held their breath like a chapel. Lamps burned low behind warded glass, throwing lattices of amber across the aisles. Hermione slid between shelves, fingers resting lightly on cracked calfskin, eyes scanning for motion in the dim.\n\nThunder rolled through the stone. Three heartbeats later it came—a tug low in her belly, a soft prickle along her lips and tongue, as if the Arcanum tasted her and wanted more. She stopped beside an atlas of tides, breath easing into the cadence. The consent charm at her throat cooled, taking the edge off want, turning it into shape and measure.\n\nShe drew a rune slip from her sleeve and braced it against the atlas’ leather. Copper ink wrote clean and narrow: interval, swell, decay. She added a notation for the upper stacks’ variance—sharper onset, faster falloff. The slip warmed and held the knot she’d tied into it.\n\nA patrol of Tempest sashes crossed a far aisle, boots soft, murmurs clipped. She kept her spine loose, the studious mask easy on her face, and let them pass. The tug came again with the next thunder; she mouthed a silent vowel to test it and felt the wards press back, coaxing the vowel toward spill. Noted.\n\nShe hooked a thumbnail under the rim of a shelf sigil and listened. Beneath the storm’s drum and the ward’s small hunger, another beat—ledger magic, counting hands and eyes. Sable’s warning threaded through her thoughts. Morwen would call the numbers before dawn.\n\nHermione slid the rune slip into her pocket, then pulled another and sketched a second pattern: counterpull at the base of the spine, redirect up the sternum, bleed off at the tongue. A breath exercise to ride the tug without giving it purchase. The siren fragment warmed in quiet answer and then settled.\n\nShe stepped into the central aisle and looked up toward the catwalks where inspection lamps would burn brightest. “In order,” she whispered to herself, amused, and let the storm’s math set her pace. If Dean Morwen came, she would meet her in this measured light—with her notes in hand and the Arcanum’s appetite translated into clean lines.\n-- Page 11 --\nFootsteps came before the light—measured, decisive, heel to toe. Hermione straightened, tucking the rune slips into her inner pocket, and let the lamps stripe her sleeves. The storm’s roll washed through the stacks; she counted the three-beat tug and rode it with the breath she’d patterned, quiet and sure.\n\nDean Morwen appeared at the far end of the aisle, inspection lamp held low, dark coat shedding a glitter of rain. Her gaze took everything at once—shelf sigils, floor dust, Hermione’s posture—then returned to fix on Hermione’s face like a pin.\n\n“Miss Granger.” No question, only the statement. Morwen’s voice was even as slate. “You are out late.”\n\n“I am in order,” Hermione said, soft but not timid. She kept her hands visible, palms faintly inked, the studious line of her mouth holding steady. “The upper stacks are showing variance in the appetite wards. I’ve logged timing and decay. It felt pertinent to have it tidy before dawn.”\n\nMorwen stepped closer, lamp tilting to catch the copper ghost on Hermione’s knuckles. A small pause, the kind she never wasted. “Show me.” She did not reach; she waited. Hermione drew one slip and passed it over, careful, the breath exercise still running under her ribs like a metronome.\n\nThunder rolled. Three heartbeats; the tug kissed her spine and tried to climb. Morwen’s eyes flicked up as if she’d felt it too. “You’ve filtered it,” the dean murmured, interest shading the word. “Without dulling your senses.”\n\n“A consent charm,” Hermione said. “It lets me name the pull and leave it there.” She kept her tone practical, as if they were discussing shelving rather than a building that wanted things from them. “Upper stacks have sharper onset, quicker decay. I’ve sketched a counterpull for patrols so no one makes sloppy decisions.”\n\nMorwen considered the slip, then Hermione. The lamp lighted a fine scar along the dean’s jaw. “You like to make yourself useful.” The words should have been cold; they weren’t. “You will accompany me while I check ledger counts. If your notes hold, we will discuss access.” She turned, expecting Hermione to fall in at her shoulder.\n\nHermione did, matching stride, counting the storm under her breath. The catwalk lamps buzzed ahead, and Tempest sashes stirred in the periphery like weather vanes testing wind. She let the quiet between them stand, pleased, a little bright at the edges. Useful was a door, if you knew how to walk through it without tripping the locks.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

The storm fussed at the windows; rain hissed in the stone like tea poured too fast. Hermione matched the dean’s measured pace, the consent charm at her throat cool as a coin.\n\nThey reached the ledger plinth. It was a block of basalt worn smooth by generations of hands, fitted with a brass cradle and a counting ring that ticked when magic moved. Morwen set the lamp down. The glow slicked across her gloves as she unlocked the cradle and turned the book open. Numbers stood like soldiers. Margins held tidy ward-notes in different inks, each dean’s mark a distinct hand.\n\nThunder rolled. The three-beat tug brushed Hermione’s mouth; she eased into her patterned breath, let it climb her sternum and bleed into her tongue without spill. Morwen’s eyes flicked up, precise and intent, as if she’d felt the same brush. “Show me the counterpull,” she said, low, not a question.\n\nHermione lifted two fingers to her lips and traced the breath through the points she’d mapped—base, rise, release—her inhale long and even, her exhale a measured thread. The air tasted like old glue and iron. When the next tug came, it found no purchase. “It names the impulse,” she said, voice steady, “and keeps it from bending judgment.”\n\nMorwen’s mouth made the smallest shape—approval, withheld but present. She nodded once and set the counting ring to idle. The brass clicked faintly. “We will test that against pressure.” She turned a page, and the ring ticked of its own accord. A red-stamped column showed a shift, entry and exit hours not quite agreeing. Morwen’s glove hovered over the figures. “Movement,” she said. “Within the last watch.”\n\nHermione kept her pulse even. The folio Sable had wanted had been here and gone again before dawn—Sable had been right. “Tempest patrols were in the upper aisles,” she offered, honest and contained. “Rime’s men like to make weather to hide hands. I can pull their last route if you wish.”\n\nMorwen did not look away from the ledger. “Do. And fetch the gatewarden. He signed the cycle. I want his memory under glass.” She closed the book with care, the way you might press a seal. Her gaze returned to Hermione, cool and considering. “Your notes hold. Access is earned by results, not eagerness. Walk with me.”\n\nThey moved on, lamp drawing a bright lane through the stacks. The hunger-ward pricked again and smoothed under Hermione’s breath. Below, the main hall exhaled in the dark, and somewhere a bell marked the hour between night and morning. Hermione felt the door in front of her, not yet open, but unlocked—its tumblers tasting of rain and iron, of a woman who liked order and would tolerate a little heat if it came labeled and clean.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Tempest routes,” Morwen said without slowing. “If he is abed, wake him. I want him coherent.” Her eyes cut over, assessing, then returned forward. “Return to the ledger plinth.”\n\nHermione nodded and peeled off at the main junction. The corridors were a throat of stone, sigils dim as embers along the baseboards. The building’s appetite flexed when thunder rolled—three soft pulses brushed the edge of her mouth and settled lower, a coaxing whisper that tried to borrow her focus. The consent charm cooled and trimmed it to shape and timing.\n\nShe slid a rune slip from her sleeve and, walking, marked the cadence: three-beat after thunder; onset gentler in the lower halls; decay longer by a breath.

Come with me, please, and bring Tempest patrol routes for the last two watches.” She kept her hands visible, the charm cool on her throat, her tone all procedure.\n\nHe swallowed and reached for a tin map case, then the route slips. “Rime’s men doubled the north stacks when the barometer plunged,” he offered, stalling. Another roll of thunder pressed through the walls. The wards brushed again—Hermione felt it, named it, and let it pass. She noted a faint uptick around door thresholds and tucked that into memory for later ink.\n\n“Good,” she said. “We’ll log it at the plinth.” She stepped back into the hall, the gatewarden falling in beside her, papers tight in his fist.

Margins held tidy ward-notes in different inks, each dean’s mark a distinct hand.\n\nThunder rolled. The three-beat tug brushed Hermione’s mouth; she eased into her patterned breath, let it climb her sternum and bleed into her tongue without spill. Morwen’s eyes flicked up, precise and intent, as if she’d felt the same brush. “Show me the counterpull,” she said, low, not a question.\n\nHermione lifted two fingers to her lips and traced the breath through the points she’d mapped—base, rise, release—her inhale long and even, her exhale a measured thread. The air tasted like old glue and iron. When the next tug came, it found no purchase. “It names the impulse,” she said, voice steady, “and keeps it from bending judgment.”\n\nMorwen’s mouth made the smallest shape—approval, withheld but present. She nodded once and set the counting ring to idle. The brass clicked faintly. “We will test that against pressure.” She turned a page, and the ring ticked of its own accord. A red-stamped column showed a shift, entry and exit hours not quite agreeing. Morwen’s glove hovered over the figures. “Movement,” she said. “Within the last watch.”\n\nHermione kept her pulse even. The folio Sable had wanted had been here and gone again before dawn—Sable had been right. “Tempest patrols were in the upper aisles,” she offered, honest and contained. “Rime’s men like to make weather to hide hands. I can pull their last route if you wish.”\n\nMorwen did not look away from the ledger. “Do. And fetch the gatewarden. He signed the cycle. I want his memory under glass.” She closed the book with care, the way you might press a seal. Her gaze returned to Hermione, cool and considering. “Your notes hold. Access is earned by results, not eagerness. Walk with me.”\n\nThey moved on, lamp drawing a bright lane through the stacks. The hunger-ward pricked again and smoothed under Hermione’s breath. Below, the main hall exhaled in the dark, and somewhere a bell marked the hour between night and morning. Hermione felt the door in front of her, not yet open, but unlocked—its tumblers tasting of rain and iron, of a woman who liked order and would tolerate a little heat if it came labeled and clean.\n-- Page 13 --\nThey descended from the catwalks into the spine of the Arcanum, Morwen’s lamp casting a steady ellipse that swallowed dust and ironwork. The storm rattled the high panes. Hermione kept her breath even, counting the long seconds between flash and drum.\n\n“Gatewarden. Tempest routes,” Morwen said without slowing. “If he is abed, wake him. I want him coherent.” Her eyes cut over, assessing, then returned forward. “Return to the ledger plinth.”\n\nHermione nodded and peeled off at the main junction. The corridors were a throat of stone, sigils dim as embers along the baseboards. The building’s appetite flexed when thunder rolled—three soft pulses brushed the edge of her mouth and settled lower, a coaxing whisper that tried to borrow her focus. The consent charm cooled and trimmed it to shape and timing.\n\nShe slid a rune slip from her sleeve and, walking, marked the cadence: three-beat after thunder; onset gentler in the lower halls; decay longer by a breath. She added a note—hunger-ward picks at response channels tied to attention and impulse; counterpull holds. The ink sank and held.\n\nThe gatewarden’s lodge glowed behind a half-closed door. He started when she stepped in, then recognized her and the set of her face. “Miss Granger—”\n\n“Dean Morwen,” she said, simple and firm. “Ledger discrepancy. Your signature on the last cycle. Come with me, please, and bring Tempest patrol routes for the last two watches.” She kept her hands visible, the charm cool on her throat, her tone all procedure.\n\nHe swallowed and reached for a tin map case, then the route slips. “Rime’s men doubled the north stacks when the barometer plunged,” he offered, stalling. Another roll of thunder pressed through the walls. The wards brushed again—Hermione felt it, named it, and let it pass. She noted a faint uptick around door thresholds and tucked that into memory for later ink.\n\n“Good,” she said. “We’ll log it at the plinth.” She stepped back into the hall, the gatewarden falling in beside her, papers tight in his fist. The storm’s math set her pace. By the time they reached the basalt block, she had the pattern trimmed and ready to lay beside Morwen’s exacting light.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

The storm fussed at the windows; rain hissed in the stone like tea poured too fast.

Morwen was already there, lamp steady, expression carved fine as a seal. The counting ring ticked once of its own accord as if to greet the papers.\n\n“Set them down,” Morwen said. The gatewarden obeyed, eyes fixed on the brass like it might bite. Hermione placed a palm on the plinth’s cool edge, her breath counted neat—base, rise, release—letting the three-beat tug roll across her ribs without catching.\n\nMorwen didn’t look at the gatewarden when she spoke to him. “You signed the last cycle.” She turned the ledger so the red column faced him. “This discrepancy is not a smudge.” Her gloved finger hovered a hair above the misaligned hours. “Speak clearly.”\n\nHe wet his lips. “Tempest doubled the north stacks when the pressure dropped. Sir Rime’s order. I—ah—let the patrol through on the half-bell and marked the return at the hour. The ring ticked twice in between.

The wards’ three-beat pull brushed her mouth and descended, patient as tide. She named it silently and let it go. Morwen’s eyes flicked to the movement of Hermione’s throat, then to the looped route. “Rime doesn’t turn for comfort,” the dean said. “He turns for cover.” She held out her hand. “Your breath-note.”\n\nHermione passed the slip. Morwen read, lid lowering, then angled the lamp toward the route. “We test at the well,” she decided. Her tone allowed no friction. To the gatewarden: “Bring your memory vial.” To Hermione, quieter: “You stay at my shoulder. If the ward presses, I want your counterpull in my ear in time with the third beat.”\n\n“Yes, Dean,” Hermione said. She felt the familiar bright thread under her sternum—the good click of being seen in the shape she’d chosen. The storm bared its teeth against the glass; the Arcanum breathed back.

Rain found the stone through hairline seams, tapping a patient code into the grout. Morwen’s lamp cut a steady halo. She halted with clean precision, gloved hand up. The gatewarden hovered two paces back, breath small.\n\nHermione’s pulse measured itself against the storm. Base, rise, release. The consent charm was a cool bead at her throat. She took in the well’s lip—the ward-carved channel scored a fraction deeper at the north quadrant, as if something had leaned there more than once.\n\n“Memory vial,” Morwen said without turning. The gatewarden fumbled the stopper, glass trembling against his thumbnail. He lifted it toward the well; the liquid inside thinned and brightened, reaching for the invisible pull.\n\nThe hunger-ward answered on cue, three beats after a blue-veined flash of lightning. It brushed Hermione’s mouth, asked for attention, tried to borrow her tongue for its own wanting. She named it under her breath and let the impulse unhook. Morwen’s head tilted, listening for the same pressure, composed and coiled.\n\nHermione traced the Tempest route slip against the well’s geometry, lining the odd lateral loop with the north-quadrant scuff. There: a shallow boot-swipe, salt crust in the scratch, not dust. Tempest leather came home wet.\n\n“Counterpull. Third beat,” Morwen murmured. Hermione leaned in, close enough to feel the dean’s steadiness, and breathed the pattern by her ear—long gather, narrow hold, tapered release—matching the cadence as the ward swelled. The pressure flattened, skidding off the line she set.\n\nThe memory vial shivered and cleared like a bell struck under water, then steadied. Morwen’s mouth made that small shape again. Approval, kept tight. “Good,” she said. “Again, and now closer to the lip.”\n\nHermione let her eyes slip to the well’s dark throat. The Siren fragment warmed in its hiding place, a faint echo against her palm that hummed in time with the storm. She kept it pressed still, eyes on Morwen, waiting for the permission she’d been promised by results.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Come with me, please, and bring Tempest patrol routes for the last two watches.” She kept her hands visible, the charm cool on her throat, her tone all procedure.\n\nHe swallowed and reached for a tin map case, then the route slips. “Rime’s men doubled the north stacks when the barometer plunged,” he offered, stalling. Another roll of thunder pressed through the walls. The wards brushed again—Hermione felt it, named it, and let it pass. She noted a faint uptick around door thresholds and tucked that into memory for later ink.\n\n“Good,” she said. “We’ll log it at the plinth.” She stepped back into the hall, the gatewarden falling in beside her, papers tight in his fist. The storm’s math set her pace. By the time they reached the basalt block, she had the pattern trimmed and ready to lay beside Morwen’s exacting light.\n-- Page 14 --\nHermione returned to the basalt plinth with the gatewarden in tow, his tin case bumping his knee and the route slips crinkling in his damp fist. Morwen was already there, lamp steady, expression carved fine as a seal. The counting ring ticked once of its own accord as if to greet the papers.\n\n“Set them down,” Morwen said. The gatewarden obeyed, eyes fixed on the brass like it might bite. Hermione placed a palm on the plinth’s cool edge, her breath counted neat—base, rise, release—letting the three-beat tug roll across her ribs without catching.\n\nMorwen didn’t look at the gatewarden when she spoke to him. “You signed the last cycle.” She turned the ledger so the red column faced him. “This discrepancy is not a smudge.” Her gloved finger hovered a hair above the misaligned hours. “Speak clearly.”\n\nHe wet his lips. “Tempest doubled the north stacks when the pressure dropped. Sir Rime’s order. I—ah—let the patrol through on the half-bell and marked the return at the hour. The ring ticked twice in between. I thought it residual.”\n\nHermione’s gaze slid to the route slips, scanning for the doubled pass. It was there, but the path knotted by the Obsidian annex and cut back oddly near the restricted well. “Residual would echo on the same shelf,” she said, soft, a nudge rather than a correction. “This tracks a lateral shift.” She tapped a tiny loop on the map. “Here.”\n\nThunder murmured. The wards’ three-beat pull brushed her mouth and descended, patient as tide. She named it silently and let it go. Morwen’s eyes flicked to the movement of Hermione’s throat, then to the looped route. “Rime doesn’t turn for comfort,” the dean said. “He turns for cover.” She held out her hand. “Your breath-note.”\n\nHermione passed the slip. Morwen read, lid lowering, then angled the lamp toward the route. “We test at the well,” she decided. Her tone allowed no friction. To the gatewarden: “Bring your memory vial.” To Hermione, quieter: “You stay at my shoulder. If the ward presses, I want your counterpull in my ear in time with the third beat.”\n\n“Yes, Dean,” Hermione said. She felt the familiar bright thread under her sternum—the good click of being seen in the shape she’d chosen. The storm bared its teeth against the glass; the Arcanum breathed back. She smoothed her sleeves, met Morwen’s gaze, and matched her step as they turned toward the restricted well, iron and rain and the promise of answers ahead.\n-- Page 15 --\nThe restricted well lay under a rib of iron, its mouth ringed with sigils that glimmered like wet teeth. Rain found the stone through hairline seams, tapping a patient code into the grout. Morwen’s lamp cut a steady halo. She halted with clean precision, gloved hand up. The gatewarden hovered two paces back, breath small.\n\nHermione’s pulse measured itself against the storm. Base, rise, release. The consent charm was a cool bead at her throat. She took in the well’s lip—the ward-carved channel scored a fraction deeper at the north quadrant, as if something had leaned there more than once.\n\n“Memory vial,” Morwen said without turning. The gatewarden fumbled the stopper, glass trembling against his thumbnail. He lifted it toward the well; the liquid inside thinned and brightened, reaching for the invisible pull.\n\nThe hunger-ward answered on cue, three beats after a blue-veined flash of lightning. It brushed Hermione’s mouth, asked for attention, tried to borrow her tongue for its own wanting. She named it under her breath and let the impulse unhook. Morwen’s head tilted, listening for the same pressure, composed and coiled.\n\nHermione traced the Tempest route slip against the well’s geometry, lining the odd lateral loop with the north-quadrant scuff. There: a shallow boot-swipe, salt crust in the scratch, not dust. Tempest leather came home wet.\n\n“Counterpull. Third beat,” Morwen murmured. Hermione leaned in, close enough to feel the dean’s steadiness, and breathed the pattern by her ear—long gather, narrow hold, tapered release—matching the cadence as the ward swelled. The pressure flattened, skidding off the line she set.\n\nThe memory vial shivered and cleared like a bell struck under water, then steadied. Morwen’s mouth made that small shape again. Approval, kept tight. “Good,” she said. “Again, and now closer to the lip.”\n\nHermione let her eyes slip to the well’s dark throat. The Siren fragment warmed in its hiding place, a faint echo against her palm that hummed in time with the storm. She kept it pressed still, eyes on Morwen, waiting for the permission she’d been promised by results.\nPlayer choice: step to the lip and run the counterpull again\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Hermione placed a palm on the plinth’s cool edge, her breath counted neat—base, rise, release—letting the three-beat tug roll across her ribs without catching.\n\nMorwen didn’t look at the gatewarden when she spoke to him. “You signed the last cycle.” She turned the ledger so the red column faced him. “This discrepancy is not a smudge.” Her gloved finger hovered a hair above the misaligned hours. “Speak clearly.”\n\nHe wet his lips. “Tempest doubled the north stacks when the pressure dropped. Sir Rime’s order. I—ah—let the patrol through on the half-bell and marked the return at the hour. The ring ticked twice in between. I thought it residual.”\n\nHermione’s gaze slid to the route slips, scanning for the doubled pass. It was there, but the path knotted by the Obsidian annex and cut back oddly near the restricted well. “Residual would echo on the same shelf,” she said, soft, a nudge rather than a correction. “This tracks a lateral shift.” She tapped a tiny loop on the map. “Here.”\n\nThunder murmured. The wards’ three-beat pull brushed her mouth and descended, patient as tide. She named it silently and let it go. Morwen’s eyes flicked to the movement of Hermione’s throat, then to the looped route. “Rime doesn’t turn for comfort,” the dean said. “He turns for cover.” She held out her hand. “Your breath-note.”\n\nHermione passed the slip. Morwen read, lid lowering, then angled the lamp toward the route. “We test at the well,” she decided. Her tone allowed no friction. To the gatewarden: “Bring your memory vial.” To Hermione, quieter: “You stay at my shoulder. If the ward presses, I want your counterpull in my ear in time with the third beat.”\n\n“Yes, Dean,” Hermione said. She felt the familiar bright thread under her sternum—the good click of being seen in the shape she’d chosen. The storm bared its teeth against the glass; the Arcanum breathed back. She smoothed her sleeves, met Morwen’s gaze, and matched her step as they turned toward the restricted well, iron and rain and the promise of answers ahead.\n-- Page 15 --\nThe restricted well lay under a rib of iron, its mouth ringed with sigils that glimmered like wet teeth. Rain found the stone through hairline seams, tapping a patient code into the grout. Morwen’s lamp cut a steady halo. She halted with clean precision, gloved hand up. The gatewarden hovered two paces back, breath small.\n\nHermione’s pulse measured itself against the storm. Base, rise, release. The consent charm was a cool bead at her throat. She took in the well’s lip—the ward-carved channel scored a fraction deeper at the north quadrant, as if something had leaned there more than once.\n\n“Memory vial,” Morwen said without turning. The gatewarden fumbled the stopper, glass trembling against his thumbnail. He lifted it toward the well; the liquid inside thinned and brightened, reaching for the invisible pull.\n\nThe hunger-ward answered on cue, three beats after a blue-veined flash of lightning. It brushed Hermione’s mouth, asked for attention, tried to borrow her tongue for its own wanting. She named it under her breath and let the impulse unhook. Morwen’s head tilted, listening for the same pressure, composed and coiled.\n\nHermione traced the Tempest route slip against the well’s geometry, lining the odd lateral loop with the north-quadrant scuff. There: a shallow boot-swipe, salt crust in the scratch, not dust. Tempest leather came home wet.\n\n“Counterpull. Third beat,” Morwen murmured. Hermione leaned in, close enough to feel the dean’s steadiness, and breathed the pattern by her ear—long gather, narrow hold, tapered release—matching the cadence as the ward swelled. The pressure flattened, skidding off the line she set.\n\nThe memory vial shivered and cleared like a bell struck under water, then steadied. Morwen’s mouth made that small shape again. Approval, kept tight. “Good,” she said. “Again, and now closer to the lip.”\n\nHermione let her eyes slip to the well’s dark throat. The Siren fragment warmed in its hiding place, a faint echo against her palm that hummed in time with the storm. She kept it pressed still, eyes on Morwen, waiting for the permission she’d been promised by results.\n-- Page 16 --\nHermione wet her lips, kept her voice steady. “Dean, permission to sample the ward with my fragment. Controlled, minimal contact.” She didn’t touch her pocket; she let the request sit between them like a measured note.\n\nMorwen’s gaze lifted from the well’s rim to Hermione’s face. No softness there, only weighing. Rain stitched in the seams above them. “Parameters,” Morwen said.\n\n“One pulse, half-length of the ward’s swell. I keep the counterpull riding third beat. Gatewarden logs clarity shift and any timbre change. You hold a tether on me.” Her fingers rested open at her sides, the consent charm a cool bead at her throat.\n\nMorwen nodded once. She drew a silk-fine filament from her sleeve and looped it around Hermione’s wrist, then fixed the other end to an iron ring sunk in the stone. “If you falter, I pull. You do not argue.” Her gloved thumb pressed briefly to the inside of Hermione’s wrist—a precise point, clinical, affirming. “Proceed.”\n\nHermione eased the Siren fragment from its hiding place—a pale shard threaded with a shadowed vein—and held it low, just above the well’s lip at the north quadrant. Lightning licked the high glass; she counted—one, two, three—and let the fragment sigh a single, pared-down hum that kissed the ward and nothing more.\n\nThe hunger-ward rose, curious and mean both. It bent toward the sound, then staggered on her counterpull, its third-beat surge skidding where she set the line. The memory vial brightened, swirling with a faint opaline sheen. A second note quivered under the main tug, like a siphon mouth opening and closing just out of sight.\n\n“Hold,” Morwen murmured. Hermione did, breath tight and clean, fragment steady. The ward’s tug sought the fragment’s vein, tested it, then relented as her tapered release drew it off. The vial steadied. Morwen’s lamp didn’t waver. “Withdraw,” she said.\n\nHermione pinched the hum closed and palmed the shard. The tether cooled against her wrist as its tension eased. She let out a small breath and met Morwen’s eye. “There’s a lateral resonance along the north channel,” she said, voice low. “Not just pull. It tastes like routing—something trained to catch a siren edge and turn it.”\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

She looked past it, at the bored clerk scratching a lottery ticket, at the window fogged with city damp, at her reflection ghosting there: dark hair braided tight, a face that gave nothing away. The old habit tugged—count exits, clock faces, glass angles. Training, from the place that no longer wanted her.\n\nHer thumb found the matchbook by accident. Black paper, a silver moth stamped on the front. The Chalk Court’s latest taste in subtlety. Inside, a single match and an address scrawled in neat block letters: 11 Milk Alley. No time, no name.

She could smell wet yeast from the bakery and the iron of the rain. The ward on the matchbook vibrated again—faster, insistent. She counted three beats and exhaled once, cold breath bright in the alley. Choices tightened like glove leather around her knuckles.\n-- Page 2 --\nMina slid along the brick until she had street again, the parcel snugged beneath her coat like a second spine. The man in gray had drifted on, head unbothered by the rain. No umbrella, no hat—water slicked his suit and didn’t seem to soak.

The parcel buzzed against her ribs, impatient and warm, like a pocketed phone that knew a number she didn’t.\n\nShe slipped to a counter lined with newspaper and salt. The vendor, a woman with inked cuticles and a cigarette that never burned down, glanced at Mina’s hands. Mina set a small velvet wrap on the paper, flipped it open with the side of a knuckle.

Mina angled her body so it read as a shrug, rubbed her thumb along the coat seam. “Later,” she told it, and it cooled to a buzz.

Mina hit the maintenance stairs two at a time, shoulders skimming paint that remembered old floods. The parcel buzzed under her coat like a trapped wasp. Above, a clipped voice kept asking for identification. She didn’t wait to hear who answered.\n\nThe stairs spat her onto a back edge of the subway, behind a shutter half-pulled and a mop bucket that smelled of bleach and hot dust. Commuters roared past in tides—wet coats, newspaper ink, the wet-dog reek of the city trying to dry itself. Over it all, something else hummed: a latticework note her training named as ward-sound.\n\nAhead, a row of turnstiles blinked the ordinary green. To the left, one was older, faceplate brass rubbed thin, card reader haloed with half-seen sigils. Not for the public. The air around it felt colder by a thumb’s width, the kind of cold that meant there was a better street tucked sideways from this one.\n\nMina slid into the angle where an ad board met a pillar and let her breathing settle. She watched the brass. The glyphs weren’t static; they pulsed, tracing a loop like a second hand that stuttered at the twelve. Four beats bright, one dim. Room to slip, if you were small enough and certain.\n\nShe flexed her fingers once and palmed a flake of chalk from the hem of her cuff. Not to draw—just to dust her knuckles, old exam habit. The parcel vibrated again, a warning or a dare. “Later,” she murmured into her collar, and it eased a hair.\n\nOn the next cycle, she moved. Smudge-step in her soles, shoulders angled, body thin as a rumor. She slid past the brass cheek of the turnstile on the dim beat, keeping skin off metal, breath held so the ward couldn’t taste it. The glyphs flicked curious, then missed their chance.\n\nCold nipped her teeth as she cleared the bar. The air changed the way river water changes when it goes under a bridge: same, but not. Spice and old books and hot copper crowded out the bleach and brake dust. Behind her, a ticket inspector laughed at something on a phone. No alarm.\n\nShe didn’t look back. She tucked into the current of a narrower hallway lit by caged bulbs, where a poster for a jazz night flickered between three languages and a fourth you had to feel with your tongue. The market was awake. The watcher in gray could decide whether he wanted the chase badly enough to get clever.\n-- Page 4 --\nThe hidden corridor opened into a low arcade of stalls and steam. Lanterns in wire cages threw soft light across tables crowded with knives that didn’t reflect, jars with breath inside, combs carved from something that remembered being alive. Mina kept her shoulders square and her coat closed. The parcel buzzed against her ribs, impatient and warm, like a pocketed phone that knew a number she didn’t.\n\nShe slipped to a counter lined with newspaper and salt. The vendor, a woman with inked cuticles and a cigarette that never burned down, glanced at Mina’s hands. Mina set a small velvet wrap on the paper, flipped it open with the side of a knuckle. Inside, a brooch in the shape of a beetle, legs jointed with fine wire, a faint sheen of bad luck pulsing in its back.\n\n“Two fifties,” the woman said without touching it.\n\n“Three,” Mina said. She tapped the beetle with a nail through a folded square of linen. The charm thrummed sour. “You’ll need to bleed it under salt. I’m saving you trouble.”\n\nThey settled at two and a half. The woman slid notes in a tea tin, wiped the counter with a stripe of ash, and pushed a carbon chit across. Mina pressed the blank line with a thumb dusted in chalk; the ink under her skin drank the space empty. No names stuck. She tucked the cash and left the beetle watching the ceiling.\n\nNear the tea stall, a man with a dock-shoulder and a shirt that didn’t match his hands hovered by a stack of crates that looked like wardrobes if you didn’t look right. “Patch?” he asked, not meeting her eyes.\n\nMina stepped close. The glamor over the top crate had slipped—edges blurring wrong, light snagging. She breathed out slow, matched her pulse to the market’s hum, then teased the seam with a bent pin and a whisper. A thread of dull gold slid into place between what the eye wanted and what the world allowed. The crate remembered it was only a wardrobe. The man exhaled. She took a roll of notes and a stick of gum she didn’t want.\n\nThe parcel kicked. Mina angled her body so it read as a shrug, rubbed her thumb along the coat seam. “Later,” she told it, and it cooled to a buzz. Across the aisle, a flier hung from a string: OFFICIAL NOTICE, all angles and small print, a keyhole stamped at the bottom. Someone had drawn a moustache on the emblem. People gave it a wide berth anyway.\n\nAt a stationer’s booth, she bought a neat stack of blank tags and a pencil that wouldn’t write names even if begged. She dated two receipts with time only, tore off the corners, and fed them to the brazier ash. The smoke left nothing that could be filed. On her way back into the flow, she let her gait loosen half a shade, just another buyer weighing whether the knives were worth their price.\n-- Page 5 --\nMina let the crowd pull her three stalls along, then edged into the shadow of a bead curtain where steam smelled like mint and rust. She set her back to the wall, palms flat against cool tile, and listened. The market had a way of talking to its regulars—knives humming in their cases, jars sighing, a baker’s oven ticking like a patient clock.\n\nThe parcel buzzed a pattern she didn’t know. Not angry, not afraid—restless. She pinched the seam through her coat and traced a small circle with her thumb, the way you’d soothe a skittish horse. “Breathe,” she said under the beads, voice low and ordinary. The vibration stepped down, stacked itself into two beats and a rest. Closer to human.\n\nA runner cut past the curtain with a brass bell tucked under his shirt, eyes on the floor. He tapped it three times against a thigh—soft clicks, not a ring. A sweep signal. Lanterns along the aisle breathed lower in answer, the way sea grass sinks before a wave. The notice with the keyhole moustache fluttered once like it was trying not to laugh.\n\nMina touched her jaw with two fingers, a habit she’d kept when nerves needed something to do. In the mirror of a polished kettle, a sliver of gray suit drifted into view at the far end of the lane. The man’s shoulders were damp with a rain that wasn’t here. He spoke to the inked vendor, and her cigarette burned a little faster.\n\n“Back door?” Mina asked the tea woman without looking up. A nod toward the bookbinder’s stall was the answer. Mina slid a pair of tens under a saucer, stepped out, and moved quick without looking like it. The binder, sleeves shiny at the elbows, lifted a ledger reflexively. She dusted her thumb. The line she signed forgot what it meant as soon as ink touched it.\n\nBehind a stack of hides, a knee-high hatch grumbled open. She folded herself through, boots finding old wood, hips skimming bilges of string and glue. Her heart ticked slow and neat. Training liked neat; panic got you counted. She pulled the hatch soft behind her and let dark and fan-noise press close.\n\nIn the service run, lights ran in a single strip like a dropped spine. The parcel jumped hard once, and a thread of warding slipped, visible to the left eye only as a pinch. “No,” she whispered, and fed it a sliver of breath and a name she hadn’t used in two years. The spark that answered bit her nailbed and was gone. The hum settled.\n\nAt the end, a door with fishscales pressed into its paint gave on a cold room that smelled like tides and metal trays. Beyond, a side exit cracked blue with night and a blink of river. A shadow peeled off a wall across the alley and didn’t move like a smoker on break. Mina adjusted her coat, loosened her shoulders, and let the door whisper shut. Ozone threaded the air from somewhere ahead—fresh ward-work, new enough to still sting. She went toward it, steps quiet, breath even, eyes soft enough to see sideways.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Chalk sigils marched along the curb, linked by copper tacks and thread as fine as spider silk. Four anchors tight, one still wet where the chalk had clumped. A keyhole the size of a freckle hid in the bind-mark, the Office’s little joke. The shadow across the way adjusted, but its edges didn’t catch light. Not a man. A watcher made of absence.\n\nMina crouched and blew at the clumped mark. Chalk smeared. Sloppy hand, rushed. Apprentice level with a template, she thought. She took a ticket stub from her pocket, tore it in half, and slid one half through the lowest span. The paper browned, curled, and stopped. A taste-lock, not a burn-net. It wanted a name.\n\nShe dusted her thumb and pressed it against the parcel through her coat. “Two and a rest,” she told it. It drummed the pattern back, soft as a heartbeat. She matched her breath to it, then tapped the wet anchor with a bent pin and a pinch of ash from her cuff. The line hiccuped. The dim beat opened.\n\nOn that breath, she crossed. Shoulders thin, gaze down, heel placed light. The ward reached for the sweat on her tongue, found chalk instead, and lost interest. The watcher’s edge sagged like damp paper and reformed behind her. She didn’t hurry. Hurrying made noise.\n\nRiver cold blew straight through the next cut. She passed stacked crab pots and a coil of rope that had swallowed three coins and a button. A shrine to the ferrymen sat under the stairs—two wax stubs and a fishbone tied with red thread. The thread had three knots. Smuggler count for clear path.\n\nShe paused, eyes adjusting to the darker strip under the quay steps. Someone had scuffed a figure eight into the grime near the drain. Practice glyph. Same hand as the ward, same rush. The Office training up fresh bodies for river work. Good to know.\n\nSoft shoes clicked on stone at the alley’s far end. Not close yet, but coming. Mina slipped under the stairs and felt along the wall until her fingers found the iron ring everyone pretended not to see. The ring twitched and swung inward. Below, wood smelled old and tar-black.

She took a ticket stub from her pocket, tore it in half, and slid one half through the lowest span. The paper browned, curled, and stopped. A taste-lock, not a burn-net. It wanted a name.\n\nShe dusted her thumb and pressed it against the parcel through her coat. “Two and a rest,” she told it. It drummed the pattern back, soft as a heartbeat. She matched her breath to it, then tapped the wet anchor with a bent pin and a pinch of ash from her cuff. The line hiccuped. The dim beat opened.\n\nOn that breath, she crossed. Shoulders thin, gaze down, heel placed light. The ward reached for the sweat on her tongue, found chalk instead, and lost interest. The watcher’s edge sagged like damp paper and reformed behind her. She didn’t hurry. Hurrying made noise.\n\nRiver cold blew straight through the next cut. She passed stacked crab pots and a coil of rope that had swallowed three coins and a button. A shrine to the ferrymen sat under the stairs—two wax stubs and a fishbone tied with red thread. The thread had three knots. Smuggler count for clear path.\n\nShe paused, eyes adjusting to the darker strip under the quay steps. Someone had scuffed a figure eight into the grime near the drain. Practice glyph. Same hand as the ward, same rush. The Office training up fresh bodies for river work. Good to know.\n\nSoft shoes clicked on stone at the alley’s far end. Not close yet, but coming. Mina slipped under the stairs and felt along the wall until her fingers found the iron ring everyone pretended not to see. The ring twitched and swung inward. Below, wood smelled old and tar-black. She angled her shoulders and went down into the gap.\n-- Page 7 --\nThe steps dropped to a crawlspace of wet wood and black water. Tar bled from the beams in slow, sticky beads. The river licked at the pilings, soft and regular. She held the ring door until it settled and let the dark close around her like a coat she knew.\n\nShe moved with one hand on the wall, fingertips picking out pegs and old nail heads. A drop ran cold down her wrist. When her palm found a smeared fishbone charm and a twist of red thread, she stopped. Three knots again. Clear path. Someone had tucked a copper under the charm. She slid another beside it. Payment calmed places like this.\n\nA dull shape waited under the quay—narrow skiff, pitch-black, tied to an iron cleat. The knot on the line had the same three-beat story as the thread. A little padlock sat in the shadow where a name should go. The parcel woke under her coat, bright for a breath.\n\n“Easy,” she said to it, thumb circling the seam. The hum stepped down. She dusted her index finger, touched the lock once, twice, pause, then once more. Ash and rhythm instead of a name. The ward blinked and let go. She eased the line free without a splash.\n\nShe knelt in the skiff and pushed off with the short pole tucked along the ribs. The hull sighed against slime. Above, the footsteps reached the ring door. Metal ticked, then stopped. Voices filtered through the boards, thin with echo. “Anchor held,” a young one said, proud and unsure. Another voice answered in a tone that didn’t move. She let her breath go quiet and counted five in her head.\n\nShe set the pole and let the skiff drift along the quay’s belly. Ahead, an iron grate crouched just above the waterline. A circle scratched on the bar carried a faint red smear and three tiny cuts. She leaned over, hand into the cold. Her fingers found a ring below the surface, slick with weed.\n\nShe tugged three times, small, then once long. Metal shifted with a swallowed groan. The grate lifted two inches. Enough. She ducked, pulled, and the skiff slid through with an inch to spare. A different breath of river hit her face from the other side—cleaner, faster. The parcel warmed once against her ribs. She didn’t look back. She set the pole, angled the bow to the darker run, and went with the current.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

A wide shadow rolls over the slate roofs, slow as a ship under full sail, then passes. Street noise resumes, carts and hoof iron, the hiss of wet gravel.\n\nShe keeps to the gutters where the cobbles are truer. Her boots pull at the muck. The river steward’s lodge sits above the ferry stairs, a squat house of oak and slate, tide lines stained on its stones.\n\nA clerk with a patchy beard looks up from a tally board. “Guild business goes through the Guild,” he says, not unkind.\n\nLyra unbuckles the case and lays out her notes with cold hands. “I’m bringing you the river as it is,” she says. “Not as Corvin sells it.”\n\nThe clerk eyes the pages and the seal stitched on her sleeve.

The skiff slid on. Lyra leaned forward and felt the pull through her knees. Straight as drawn wire. \"Hold her steady,\" she said. \"Give me a touch on the port.\"\n\nMarden adjusted the oar. The bow corrected and the current settled under them. Hobb set the butt of the river-rod to the thwart, marked a notch with chalk, and squinted past Lyra's shoulder. \"Reeds thick on the east,\" he said, mostly to himself.\n\n\"As I told you,\" Lyra said. She kept her voice even. Her thumb found the seam of her case and left it be. \"Past the willow, the race sits half-drowned.\"\n\nThe stakes showed as black teeth in the skin of the river. Lyra reached with her oar and tapped one. It gave a dull knock. Tar and rot rose sharp. Hobb bent and scraped a flake into his slate notch. Marden watched the set of the current around the ruins. His mouth went tight. \"Guild chart puts this east of us if the bend holds.\"\n\nSomething thin hummed to their right. The mist furred and showed a taut line at knee height, a faint thread that slanted toward the unseen cross. The skiff eased through it. The thread flickered and snapped with a dry pop. Nettle and hot iron stung Lyra's nose. Hobb flinched and hugged the slate to his chest.\n\nOverhead, heat brushed her scalp and drifted off. A broad shadow passed in the milk of the mist and was gone. Marden did not look up. He set his jaw and dipped the oar again. \"That's your willow. That's your race. Current keeps north.\"\n\n\"Cairn stones next,\" Lyra said. \"West bank. You’ll see where hands worked them.\" She pointed, and Marden angled them in. The stones hunched above a muddy shelf. Lichen tore in clean crescents. Fresh scrape marks showed pale beneath the green.\n\nMarden stood and sighted along the rod. The tip wanted north. He grunted, low. \"Hobb, mark the scarring. Date it.\" He sat again and met Lyra's eye. \"We’ll lodge the challenge.\" A note, low as a drumhead, rolled up through the hull, and the mist around the stones trembled, then stilled.\n\n-- Page 6 --\nMarden braced his boots against the muddied shelf and held out a hand. “Seal,” he said. Hobb passed him a tin box with a leather strap and a brass stamp gone smooth at the grip.\n\nMarden thumbed the box open. Inside lay a coil of red cord, a lead disk, and a scrap of blue wax. He looped the cord through a chink in the cairn, fed the lead on, and warmed the wax with his breath. “Witness and ward,” he said, quiet and plain. He pressed the stamp. The seal took with a dull click.\n\nThe low note came again, deeper. It thrummed the water against the skiff’s ribs. Small bubbles crept out from under the stones and broke in tight pops. Lyra tasted copper. The mist around the cairn drew back a hand’s breadth, then sighed closed.\n\nHobb scratched on his slate, eyes wide. “Seal set at west cairn,” he muttered. “Alignment north. Ward-thread broken east.” His chalk left grubby halos on the wet board.\n\nOverhead, heat feathered the air and moved on. A drift of ash settled on the skiff’s thwart, no bigger than oat husks. Lyra brushed them off and kept her face still. “We should go,” she said. “If the river’s listening, so are they.”\n\nMarden nodded and shoved them off with the oar. The skiff slid free. Water slapped the planks and the leak on the left made its slow drip. He set a steady stroke. “Back to the stairs. We write, we ring the Pact, and we hang notice on the ferry post.”\n\nLyra held the bow true while the current carried them north another span before the turn. Reeds whispered on the east bank. A heron lifted and vanished in gray. The ferry bell spoke once, then twice, thin and far. She laid a hand on her case and felt the shape of her pencil through the leather, solid as a nail.\n\nAs the steps loomed out of the mist, the note under the hull faded to a prickly hush. Hobb blew on his slate to fix the chalk and hugged it like bread. Marden spat in the river and set his jaw. “Corvin will come running,” he said. “Let him.”\n-- Page 7 --\nThey bumped the ferry steps and took the ladder two at a time. Wet stone, old rope, and the thin tang of ash rode the air even here. Hobb hugged his slate. Marden kept the tin box under his arm like a loaf.\n\nThe Guild hall doors stood open. Inside, benches lined the walls and map cases loomed like coffers. Ink and wool grease mixed with damp. In the center, the Pact-stone squatted under its iron hoop. It had a gray sheen, like river clay in shade.\n\nMarden went to the clerk’s rail and rapped once with his knuckles. “Challenge lodged,” he said. He set the coiled cord and the pressed seal on the plank. Hobb slid the slate beside it. The Pact-stone answered with a low hum that pressed on the teeth.\n\nLyra kept a hand on her case. The sound went through her palm. She watched the hoop tremble a hair. A bell line ran from it up to the roof lath. Somewhere above, a small hammer clicked twice.\n\nBootheels came quick on the boards to the left. Master Corvin swept in with his blue sash crooked. He didn’t look at Lyra first; he looked at the slate. “Grayfen bends east by the Cross,” he said. “It must. The ward lines sit on it. The Abbey leases on it. You cannot make it straight because you fancy a walk.”\n\n“It’s straight because the river runs straight,” Lyra said. She kept her voice even. “We broke a ward-thread where your bend cuts air. The cairn’s been moved. Marden saw it. Hobb marked it.” She pointed once to the dull lead and wax on the rail.\n\nCorvin’s jaw worked. He lifted Hobb’s slate and read the grubby marks, then set it down with care. “Rivers bend,” he said. “They always have here. That is the line.” His finger stabbed a wall chart where an inked curve swept neat. The Pact-stone’s hum rose a note and steadied. Marden folded his arms.

He flicked a glance at her case. “You will withdraw this. The Abbey will not have its leases toyed with.”\n\nLyra set her case on the rail and unbuckled it. She slid out a damp tracing and laid it flat. The Pact-stone’s hum lifted half a tone. The iron hoop ticked once against its bolts.\n\nMarden stepped closer. “Seal is set. Challenge stands. We post at the ferry and take witness again at first light. You want it bent, you come to the cairn.” He kept his voice even, but his hand stayed on the tin box.\n\nCorvin reached for the tracing. Hobb moved quicker than he looked; he brought the slate up between. Chalk dust smudged Corvin’s fingertips. “Filed mark,” Hobb said, breath short. “Don’t smear it.”\n\n“The wards are wound off that bend,” Corvin said. He wiped his hand and kept his eyes on Lyra. “You snap threads, you invite heat. The Abbey tithe binds half the barge trade.”\n\nLyra tapped the rent in the wax with her nail. “Thread broke where there was no water. We smelled it burn. We saw ash fall. Your bend crosses air.” She held his gaze and did not blink.\n\nAbove them, something shifted in the rafters. A sift of gray came down on the hoop. The bell line quivered and the small hammer clicked twice, slow as a breath. A pair of apprentices at the doorway went quiet.\n\nMarden nodded once, as if that settled it. “Notice goes up. Dawn at the west cairn. Bring your Abbey man and your chart.” He looked at Corvin’s sash. “And bring hands to reset what was moved.”\n\nCorvin’s mouth bent the other way. “I will bring the Prior,” he said. He straightened the sash and stepped back. “You will answer him.” He turned on his heel and went for the far door. The boards creaked under his weight.\n\nLyra rolled her tracing and slid it away. Her fingers found the pencil’s weight and held it. “Dawn, then,” she said. She felt the hum ease under her palm, like a promise settling into place.\n-- Page 9 --\nThey stepped back into the mist. Street lamps showed as weak smudges. Rope creaked where the ferry line ran to its ring.\n\nAt the post by the stairs, Marden took a nail from his mouth and tapped the notice up. The paper buckled under the wet. He pressed the lead seal to it so the cord showed clear. “There,” he said.\n\nHobb tugged the bell-rope. The small ferry bell answered with three thin blows. Sound ran along the water and went flat in the fog. A pair of barge hands on the far landing paused with a coil between them, listening.\n\nLyra read the posted lines without moving her lips. Dawn, west cairn, steward witness. Her fingers itched to redraw every letter to keep them from slipping in the damp. She wiped a bead of mist from her eyelashes with a knuckle.\n\nBoots scuffed behind them. A boy in an Abbey gray hood slowed, stared at the seal, and then hurried on. Tar smoke from the rope hearth mixed with the sour of wet wool. Somewhere upriver, an ox coughed in its yoke.\n\nMarden tipped his chin toward the steps. “Sleep if you can,” he said. “Don’t speak to anyone who asks too many soft questions.” He eyed her case. “Bring what you walked with. No more, no less.”\n\n“I’ll be here before first light,” Lyra said. She checked the pencil in its slot. The stub felt right under her thumb. She looked once at the black water sliding past the piles. “Straight,” she said, quiet for herself.\n\nOverhead the mist thinned for a breath. Heat moved across the skin like a hand and was gone. Ash dusted the notice. Marden brushed it off and gave the bell-rope one last pull. The sound went out into the gray and did not come back.\n-- Page 10 --\nLyra took the lane up from the ferry, boots whispering on wet grit. Lamps threw small halos and died. The mist pressed close and made the houses into hulks.\n\nShe kept her case under her arm and her free hand in her cloak.

Marden waited with the skiff rope in hand, cap beaded with wet. Hobb stood by the post with the slate and the river-rod tucked under his arm. Lyra nodded once and kept her case close under her cloak.\n\n“You brought only what you walked with,” Marden said, eye flicking to her boots. He didn’t make it a question. He jerked his chin to the skiff. “We go now.”\n\nFootsteps came from the lane. Corvin appeared with a dark-robed Prior and two Abbey hands. The Prior’s hood was back. His hair was white at the temples and clipped short. He smelled faintly of cold incense, like a hearth raked out.\n\n“The Abbey stands on the filed line,” Corvin said as he stepped down. “We will see your error corrected.” He did not look at Lyra’s face, only at her case.\n\n“We will see what the river says,” Marden replied. He handed Hobb the stern pole and set his tin box between his feet. The lead seal on its string touched the thwart and gave a small, steady tick.\n\nThey pushed off. The skiff slid into gray that swallowed the far bank. Water lapped at the ribs. Ash speckled the surface and went soft. Lyra kept her eyes on the west line where the crooked willow would loom when they drew near. Her thumb found the nick in her pencil and rested there.\n\nThe cairn took shape out of the mist, stones dark and slick. Marden put them ashore on the churned bank. His seal on the top stone held. He brushed cinder from the wax and showed the stamp to the Prior. The Prior nodded once and lifted a short wand wound with thread the color of old bone.\n\n“Lay your ward along the filed bend,” the Prior told Corvin, voice flat as a millstone. Hobb offered the river-rod with both hands, caught between them. Corvin took it, jaw tight, and started the thread from the cairn toward the south.\n\nLyra stepped to the edge and pointed north. “Straight past the willow there, and the fallen mill race beyond. You can hear the race when the wind turns.” As if on cue, a faint clatter came through the fog.\n\nThe thread hummed while Corvin walked it south. At three strides it dragged against nothing and sang higher. A dry heat licked Lyra’s knuckles. The line went bright, then parted with a small spit. Ash lifted in a slow swirl. Hobb flinched and caught the free end before it fell in the mud.\n\nMarden did not smile. He reset the line in Lyra’s direction. “Now the true.” He looked to the Prior. The Prior’s mouth thinned, but he raised his hand in assent.\n\nLyra took the rod and led the thread north along the water’s skin. The hum settled low. No heat pushed her hand. The willow loomed, crooked and wet. The broken timbers of the mill race showed where the bank undercut. She set the thread to a stone and stood back.\n\n“Write it,” Marden said to Hobb without looking away. Chalk touched slate. The tin box ticked, regular as pulse. The Prior watched the line like he could make it err by will alone and did not speak.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

The step creaked once more and then stilled. She stood in the dark until her breath steadied.\n\nShe dozed in her cloak with her back to the door and woke to the bare gray of not-yet morning. The mist in the court had thickened. She shouldered the case, checked the knife again, and went out. The air tasted of cinder and river. She took the lane at a steady pace toward the ferry and did not look at the roofs.\n-- Page 11 --\nMist lay in folds over the ferry steps. Marden waited with the skiff rope in hand, cap beaded with wet. Hobb stood by the post with the slate and the river-rod tucked under his arm. Lyra nodded once and kept her case close under her cloak.\n\n“You brought only what you walked with,” Marden said, eye flicking to her boots. He didn’t make it a question. He jerked his chin to the skiff. “We go now.”\n\nFootsteps came from the lane. Corvin appeared with a dark-robed Prior and two Abbey hands. The Prior’s hood was back. His hair was white at the temples and clipped short. He smelled faintly of cold incense, like a hearth raked out.\n\n“The Abbey stands on the filed line,” Corvin said as he stepped down. “We will see your error corrected.” He did not look at Lyra’s face, only at her case.\n\n“We will see what the river says,” Marden replied. He handed Hobb the stern pole and set his tin box between his feet. The lead seal on its string touched the thwart and gave a small, steady tick.\n\nThey pushed off. The skiff slid into gray that swallowed the far bank. Water lapped at the ribs. Ash speckled the surface and went soft. Lyra kept her eyes on the west line where the crooked willow would loom when they drew near. Her thumb found the nick in her pencil and rested there.\n\nThe cairn took shape out of the mist, stones dark and slick. Marden put them ashore on the churned bank. His seal on the top stone held. He brushed cinder from the wax and showed the stamp to the Prior. The Prior nodded once and lifted a short wand wound with thread the color of old bone.\n\n“Lay your ward along the filed bend,” the Prior told Corvin, voice flat as a millstone. Hobb offered the river-rod with both hands, caught between them. Corvin took it, jaw tight, and started the thread from the cairn toward the south.\n\nLyra stepped to the edge and pointed north. “Straight past the willow there, and the fallen mill race beyond. You can hear the race when the wind turns.” As if on cue, a faint clatter came through the fog.\n\nThe thread hummed while Corvin walked it south. At three strides it dragged against nothing and sang higher. A dry heat licked Lyra’s knuckles. The line went bright, then parted with a small spit. Ash lifted in a slow swirl. Hobb flinched and caught the free end before it fell in the mud.\n\nMarden did not smile. He reset the line in Lyra’s direction. “Now the true.” He looked to the Prior. The Prior’s mouth thinned, but he raised his hand in assent.\n\nLyra took the rod and led the thread north along the water’s skin. The hum settled low. No heat pushed her hand. The willow loomed, crooked and wet. The broken timbers of the mill race showed where the bank undercut. She set the thread to a stone and stood back.\n\n“Write it,” Marden said to Hobb without looking away. Chalk touched slate. The tin box ticked, regular as pulse. The Prior watched the line like he could make it err by will alone and did not speak.\n-- Page 12 --\nThe line held steady along the water’s rim. The hum ran low and even. Lyra watched the thread where it crossed a veer in the current and did not reach to touch it.\n\nThe Prior came close enough that damp beaded on his lashes. He tipped his wand once over the thread and listened like a man to a door. “It holds,” he said. He glanced at the cairn cap. “You set a steward’s seal after tampering was seen.”\n\n“North stone twisted,” Marden said. He touched the wax with a fingertip. “Seal stands.”\n\nCorvin cut in. “The bank shifts. The willow shifts. The filed bend accounts for flood and slump. Your ‘straight’ is a cart-maker’s fancy.” He lifted his chin at Lyra but kept his eyes on the thread.\n\n“You can hear the race,” Lyra said. She pointed through the fog where the broken timbers showed dark. “You hear it when it’s right. It’s right.” The faint clatter came again under the lapping water.\n\nThe Prior did not argue. “Canon asks a cross-check.” He turned to Marden. “Midstream to the east stones.” He signaled the Abbey hands. They nodded and stepped back to the skiff.\n\nThey pushed off. The skiff nosed past the crooked willow. Mist beaded on Lyra’s brow and ran cold into her collar. She kept the rod high and the thread clear of a drift log. Hobb braced the stern and wrote tight on the slate when the box ticked.\n\nA dry breath passed overhead and ash speckled the gunwale. The Prior spoke three short words toward the water. The eddy eased. The hum stayed low in Lyra’s teeth.\n\nMidway the current tugged. A flat stone lay just under the skin, slick with river weed. Lyra set the rod foot to it. The line did not flare or thin. The Prior marked a tally on a strip of lead with his stylus.\n\nThey made the east bank where rootwork showed like knuckles. Marden set the thread to a shore stone and back-marked with his knife on the bark above. “Witnessed,” he said. Hobb read the slate and nodded once.\n\nBack at the cairn, Marden warmed his seal in his palm and pressed a second sign into the wax. The stamp’s face came away clean. The Prior lowered his wand. “The filed bend is in error,” he said. He looked at Corvin. “You will withdraw it.”\n\nCorvin’s mouth tightened. “We will review in Guild,” he said. Low, to Lyra: “You make enemies you don’t see.”\n\nShe met his look and let it slide off. “Straight,” she said, no louder than before.\n\nFrom upriver a deeper note rolled under the mist, not a bell. The cairn stone warmed against Lyra’s palm as if something listened. Ash sifted down in a slow fall. Marden drew breath through his teeth. “Guild hall, then,” he said. “Let the Pact take the correction.”\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

She tests the seal, feels a faint prickle, and asks the coachman who sealed it; he says the headmistress. The gate stirs and a lantern appears as she pockets the letter again.\nPassage: Aria held on the carriage step and slipped the letter from her coat. Rain licked at the threshold and hissed on the cobbles.\n\nDark wax sealed the flap. A blackthorn sprig crossed a small iron key under a hollow crown. Fine letters ringed it, cut so thin they looked carved into frost.\n\nShe tilted it to the lightning. The sigil caught and went dull again. The wax felt colder than the air. Resin and smoke clung to the parchment.\n\n\"Who sealed it?\" she asked without looking up.\n\n\"Headmistress,\" the coachman said. His mask took the rain; his eyes did not meet hers. \"They make a point of it.\"\n\nAria set a thumbnail to the edge. The wax held like a clenched jaw. A faint prickle ran up her wrist and settled in her shoulder.\n\nThe bell tolled again, closer. The gate breathed open a hand, iron wet and black. Somewhere under the arcade, a lantern moved and then stopped.\n\nShe slid the letter back inside her coat and closed her hand over it. The storm waited for her answer.\nPrevious summary: Aria arrives by carriage at Blackthorn Academy under a stormy sky and prepares to step out as the doors open and lightning carves runes in the clouds.\n\nRevise the plan to fit this trajectory.

Maintain tight continuity and concrete, readable prose.\nTone/Influence blend: wednesday adams and harry potter\nSetting: Gothic academy under a storm-borne sky\nProtagonist: Aria Nightshade, a keen-eyed Goth prodigy\nGenre: Dark fantasy\nAvoid meta commentary. Never reveal internal planning. Make this story easy to read. Progress the scene naturally each turn.\nStyle: Write lean, concrete prose. Prefer plain, contemporary diction; concrete nouns and active verbs.\nSentence architecture: Mostly simple declaratives (avg 12–18 words); avoid semicolons; em dashes sparingly; at most one subordinate clause.\nFigurative discipline: Use at most one fresh, in-world metaphor or simile per page, only if it clarifies mood or action. Do not stack or extend a metaphor. Avoid cosmic/abstract analogies.\nPOV integrity: Any image must be something the viewpoint character would plausibly think or notice.\nLiteral-first: Prefer literal sensory description and specific action beats; reach for comparison only when it makes the moment clearer.\nSelf-edit: Remove mixed/cliché metaphors and decorative modifiers that do not carry weight; prefer literal rephrasings.\nDialogue: Treat talk as action under pressure. Each turn should answer the prior move (answer, qualify, push back, or pivot) and carry its own small aim. Avoid orphaned declarations.\nAdjacency pairs: Close the loop—question→answer (or refusal), claim→challenge, offer→accept/decline. You may let a pair trail only if a beat undercuts it and creates a new hook.\nBeats & attribution: Weave brief action/reaction beats into the same sentence or the next to track speaker and status shifts. Prefer plain tags (\"said\", \"asked\"); keep names light; avoid ornate tags.\nCadence: Favor 2–4 sentences per turn on average; mix one short with one longer, and let clauses link when useful.

The academy’s wards prickle as Aria crosses the threshold; a watcher peers from an upper window as the bell falls silent.\nPassage: Aria stepped down. Cold hit her face and the iron in the air tasted like pennies. Rain slid off the gate and ran in thin lines down the bars.\n\nThe lantern came closer, steady despite the wind. A girl in a black coat held it high, hood back, hair slick to her skull. The brass frame hissed when drops found it. A badge on her throat showed the blackthorn sprig and key under a hollow crown.\n\n\"Aria Nightshade?\" she asked. Her voice carried without effort.\n\n\"Yes,\" Aria said. She kept one hand in her coat, flat over the letter.\n\nThe coachman set her trunk down with a wet thud and stepped back. He did not look at her. Water pearled on the silver of his mask and ran off the jaw.\n\n\"I'm Prefect Morwen Grey,\" the girl said, shifting the lantern to free a hand. Aria did not take it; Morwen let it drop without comment. \"Come on. Before the bell ends.\"\n\nThey crossed under the arch. Gargoyles crouched in the gutters and spat rain in ropes. Runes scratched into the ironwork darkened and shone as the lantern passed. A thin shiver touched Aria’s skin when she stepped over the threshold; the letter cooled against her ribs.\n\n\"Headmistress is waiting,\" Morwen said. She glanced at Aria’s coat. \"Keep that sealed until she asks for it.\"\n\n\"I heard,\" Aria said. A window flared above them, then dulled. A figure watched, then moved away.\n\nThe inner door stood thick and wet with old polish. Morwen rapped once. The bell tolled its last note as the lock turned from within.\nPrevious summary: Aria pauses on the carriage step to examine the sealed letter, noting Blackthorn's crest in the wax. She tests the seal, feels a faint prickle, and asks the coachman who sealed it; he says the headmistress. The gate stirs and a lantern appears as she pockets the letter again.\n\nRevise the plan to fit this trajectory. JSON only, no extra keys."}

Aria counted each jolt like a bead on a string and let the dark settle in.\n\nA wolf howled once, clipped by thunder. The sound did not repeat. She smiled at the restraint.\n\nAhead, a ridge broke. Blackthorn Academy rose from it, all spires and iron ribs, lit in lashes of white. Lightning traced shapes like runes across the belly of the clouds.\n\nThe carriage slowed. Wet gravel hissed under the wheels. A bell tolled from somewhere high, as if the tower cleared its throat.\n\n\"End of the road, miss,\" said the coachman through his silver mask. He did not turn his head. Rain tapped the metal like fingernails.\n\nAria folded her letter and slid it into her coat. Wax and parchment, cold against her ribs. If she hesitated, the place would remember.\n\nThe carriage rocked to a stop at the gate. The door latch clicked, then lifted itself. Wind pushed in with the smell of iron and wet stone.\n\nThe doors swung wide. Iron clouds etched fresh sigils above the courtyard as she set one boot toward rain-lacquered cobbles.\n-- Page 2 --\nAria held on the carriage step and slipped the letter from her coat. Rain licked at the threshold and hissed on the cobbles.\n\nDark wax sealed the flap. A blackthorn sprig crossed a small iron key under a hollow crown. Fine letters ringed it, cut so thin they looked carved into frost.\n\nShe tilted it to the lightning. The sigil caught and went dull again. The wax felt colder than the air. Resin and smoke clung to the parchment.\n\n\"Who sealed it?\" she asked without looking up.\n\n\"Headmistress,\" the coachman said. His mask took the rain; his eyes did not meet hers. \"They make a point of it.\"\n\nAria set a thumbnail to the edge. The wax held like a clenched jaw. A faint prickle ran up her wrist and settled in her shoulder.\n\nThe bell tolled again, closer. The gate breathed open a hand, iron wet and black. Somewhere under the arcade, a lantern moved and then stopped.\n\nShe slid the letter back inside her coat and closed her hand over it. The storm waited for her answer.\n-- Page 3 --\nAria stepped down. Cold hit her face and the iron in the air tasted like pennies. Rain slid off the gate and ran in thin lines down the bars.\n\nThe lantern came closer, steady despite the wind. A girl in a black coat held it high, hood back, hair slick to her skull. The brass frame hissed when drops found it. A badge on her throat showed the blackthorn sprig and key under a hollow crown.\n\n\"Aria Nightshade?\" she asked. Her voice carried without effort.\n\n\"Yes,\" Aria said. She kept one hand in her coat, flat over the letter.\n\nThe coachman set her trunk down with a wet thud and stepped back. He did not look at her. Water pearled on the silver of his mask and ran off the jaw.\n\n\"I'm Prefect Morwen Grey,\" the girl said, shifting the lantern to free a hand. Aria did not take it; Morwen let it drop without comment. \"Come on. Before the bell ends.\"\n\nThey crossed under the arch. Gargoyles crouched in the gutters and spat rain in ropes. Runes scratched into the ironwork darkened and shone as the lantern passed. A thin shiver touched Aria’s skin when she stepped over the threshold; the letter cooled against her ribs.\n\n\"Headmistress is waiting,\" Morwen said. She glanced at Aria’s coat. \"Keep that sealed until she asks for it.\"\n\n\"I heard,\" Aria said. A window flared above them, then dulled.

Maintain tight continuity and concrete, readable prose.\nTone/Influence blend: wednesday adams and harry potter\nSetting: Gothic academy under a storm-borne sky\nProtagonist: Aria Nightshade, a keen-eyed Goth prodigy\nGenre: Dark fantasy\nAvoid meta commentary. Never reveal internal planning. Make this story easy to read. Progress the scene naturally each turn.\nStyle: Write lean, concrete prose. Prefer plain, contemporary diction; concrete nouns and active verbs.\nSentence architecture: Mostly simple declaratives (avg 12–18 words); avoid semicolons; em dashes sparingly; at most one subordinate clause.\nFigurative discipline: Use at most one fresh, in-world metaphor or simile per page, only if it clarifies mood or action. Do not stack or extend a metaphor. Avoid cosmic/abstract analogies.\nPOV integrity: Any image must be something the viewpoint character would plausibly think or notice.\nLiteral-first: Prefer literal sensory description and specific action beats; reach for comparison only when it makes the moment clearer.\nSelf-edit: Remove mixed/cliché metaphors and decorative modifiers that do not carry weight; prefer literal rephrasings.\nDialogue: Treat talk as action under pressure. Each turn should answer the prior move (answer, qualify, push back, or pivot) and carry its own small aim. Avoid orphaned declarations.\nAdjacency pairs: Close the loop—question→answer (or refusal), claim→challenge, offer→accept/decline. You may let a pair trail only if a beat undercuts it and creates a new hook.\nBeats & attribution: Weave brief action/reaction beats into the same sentence or the next to track speaker and status shifts. Prefer plain tags (\"said\", \"asked\"); keep names light; avoid ornate tags.\nCadence: Favor 2–4 sentences per turn on average; mix one short with one longer, and let clauses link when useful. Reserve single-line volleys for heat; avoid machine-gun alternation.\nSubtext: Let motive leak through diction, silence, and beats rather than explicit explanation. Do not explain the feeling; show its pressure.\nThis turn: subtly work toward this next planned sub-step: \"Faculty in sable observe her with quills that record heartbeat cadence\". Remember: the reader is not aware of this planned step—do not assume they already know what's happening. Gently orient them and err slightly toward clarity using diegetic means (dialogue, internal thought, or concrete sensory description), not literal exposition. Weave it in naturally. Keep the focus slight; do not reveal any meta-planning or say you are following a plan.\nDo NOT include an \"options\" field for this page.\nAlways answer strictly as JSON with fields: {\"passage\": string, \"summary\": string, \"notes\": string[], \"options\"?: [string, string, string]}.\nThe \"notes\" array should contain at most 2 short bullet points of factual details to remember for future coherence (e.g., names, goals, discovered clues).\nPassage should be 6-8 short paragraphs.\nWrite in a clear, approachable voice—concrete and to the point. Avoid flowery or overly abstract language. Keep it readable and engaging without being simplistic.\nDo not recap or explicitly repeat what already happened in earlier pages unless strictly necessary. Let the scene progress naturally and vary word choice to avoid repetition.\nIf options are present, they must be exactly three and short. They must not be prefixed with anything.

Cold hit her face and the iron in the air tasted like pennies. Rain slid off the gate and ran in thin lines down the bars.\n\nThe lantern came closer, steady despite the wind. A girl in a black coat held it high, hood back, hair slick to her skull. The brass frame hissed when drops found it. A badge on her throat showed the blackthorn sprig and key under a hollow crown.\n\n\"Aria Nightshade?\" she asked. Her voice carried without effort.\n\n\"Yes,\" Aria said. She kept one hand in her coat, flat over the letter.\n\nThe coachman set her trunk down with a wet thud and stepped back. He did not look at her. Water pearled on the silver of his mask and ran off the jaw.\n\n\"I'm Prefect Morwen Grey,\" the girl said, shifting the lantern to free a hand. Aria did not take it; Morwen let it drop without comment. \"Come on. Before the bell ends.\"\n\nThey crossed under the arch. Gargoyles crouched in the gutters and spat rain in ropes. Runes scratched into the ironwork darkened and shone as the lantern passed. A thin shiver touched Aria’s skin when she stepped over the threshold; the letter cooled against her ribs.\n\n\"Headmistress is waiting,\" Morwen said. She glanced at Aria’s coat. \"Keep that sealed until she asks for it.\"\n\n\"I heard,\" Aria said. A window flared above them, then dulled. A figure watched, then moved away.\n\nThe inner door stood thick and wet with old polish. Morwen rapped once. The bell tolled its last note as the lock turned from within.\n-- Page 4 --\nThe door opened on its own weight. Warmth moved out and smelled of beeswax, chalk, and damp wool. A narrow hall ran inward under a black ceiling ribbed like a spine.\n\nMorwen stepped through first. Water fell from their coats into a shallow gutter cut along the stones. Candles burned in iron cages on the walls and hissed when a drop found them.\n\nPortraits watched from either side. Eyes clicked as they tracked the lantern. One canvas showed a girl with a thorn crown and ink on her fingers; the ink crawled and then stilled when Aria looked back.\n\n“Keep to the dark tiles,” Morwen said without turning. Her boots touched only the charcoal squares. Pale ones showed faint sigils like pressed leaves. Aria matched her steps and felt a dry crackle under her soles.\n\n“Who was in the window?” Aria asked. Her voice came low, as if the walls held it.\n\n“The Archivist,” Morwen said. She eased a door with her shoulder and led them past a case of labeled bones. “He likes first nights. He writes them down.” The case fogged a little where Aria breathed.\n\nThunder rolled soft through the stone. They climbed a short stair, past a brass clock whose hands were bone. At the landing, a tall green door waited. Its knocker was a thorned key; the metal felt cool and slightly oily when Morwen touched it.\n\n“Answer what she asks. Don’t volunteer,” Morwen said. She wiped rain from her mouth with her wrist and looked at Aria’s coat. “And keep it sealed.”\n\n“I heard,” Aria said. The letter lay cold and flat against her ribs. The knocker stirred, as if it knew her name, and a voice from within said, “Enter.”\n-- Page 5 --\nMorwen pushed the door. Warmth breathed out, thicker here, as if the room kept its own weather. Aria stepped in and let the dark close behind her.\n\nA long table waited under a bank of windows. Rain clawed at the glass. Figures in sable sat in a line, faces pale above high collars, hands still.\n\nBefore each of them lay a sheet of cream paper and a black quill. The quills stirred when Aria crossed the threshold. They lifted, twitched, and began to write in short strokes.\n\nThe sound came first as a faint scratch. It steadied, then fell into a pattern that matched the thud in Aria’s throat. When she held her breath, the strokes ran faster, then slowed when she let it out.\n\n“Miss Nightshade,” said a voice from the far end. A woman stood by the window, one hand on the frame, the storm lighting the edge of her profile. “Come forward.”\n\nMorwen stopped just inside and set the lantern on a hook. “Headmistress,” she said. Aria moved to the striped runner and kept her boots on its center line.\n\n“Your letter,” the woman said. She did not turn yet. The faculty watched without blinking; the quills kept time.\n\nAria slid a hand into her coat and touched the seal. “I have it,” she said. She left it closed.\n\n“You were told to keep it sealed,” the headmistress said, and now she turned. Her eyes took her in and passed on, as if measuring the room through Aria. “You will.”\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Warmth moved out and smelled of beeswax, chalk, and damp wool. A narrow hall ran inward under a black ceiling ribbed like a spine.\n\nMorwen stepped through first. Water fell from their coats into a shallow gutter cut along the stones. Candles burned in iron cages on the walls and hissed when a drop found them.\n\nPortraits watched from either side. Eyes clicked as they tracked the lantern. One canvas showed a girl with a thorn crown and ink on her fingers; the ink crawled and then stilled when Aria looked back.\n\n“Keep to the dark tiles,” Morwen said without turning. Her boots touched only the charcoal squares. Pale ones showed faint sigils like pressed leaves. Aria matched her steps and felt a dry crackle under her soles.\n\n“Who was in the window?” Aria asked. Her voice came low, as if the walls held it.\n\n“The Archivist,” Morwen said. She eased a door with her shoulder and led them past a case of labeled bones. “He likes first nights. He writes them down.” The case fogged a little where Aria breathed.\n\nThunder rolled soft through the stone. They climbed a short stair, past a brass clock whose hands were bone. At the landing, a tall green door waited. Its knocker was a thorned key; the metal felt cool and slightly oily when Morwen touched it.\n\n“Answer what she asks. Don’t volunteer,” Morwen said. She wiped rain from her mouth with her wrist and looked at Aria’s coat. “And keep it sealed.”\n\n“I heard,” Aria said. The letter lay cold and flat against her ribs. The knocker stirred, as if it knew her name, and a voice from within said, “Enter.”\n-- Page 5 --\nMorwen pushed the door. Warmth breathed out, thicker here, as if the room kept its own weather. Aria stepped in and let the dark close behind her.\n\nA long table waited under a bank of windows. Rain clawed at the glass. Figures in sable sat in a line, faces pale above high collars, hands still.\n\nBefore each of them lay a sheet of cream paper and a black quill. The quills stirred when Aria crossed the threshold. They lifted, twitched, and began to write in short strokes.\n\nThe sound came first as a faint scratch. It steadied, then fell into a pattern that matched the thud in Aria’s throat. When she held her breath, the strokes ran faster, then slowed when she let it out.\n\n“Miss Nightshade,” said a voice from the far end. A woman stood by the window, one hand on the frame, the storm lighting the edge of her profile. “Come forward.”\n\nMorwen stopped just inside and set the lantern on a hook. “Headmistress,” she said. Aria moved to the striped runner and kept her boots on its center line.\n\n“Your letter,” the woman said. She did not turn yet. The faculty watched without blinking; the quills kept time.\n\nAria slid a hand into her coat and touched the seal. “I have it,” she said. She left it closed.\n\n“You were told to keep it sealed,” the headmistress said, and now she turned. Her eyes took her in and passed on, as if measuring the room through Aria. “You will.”\n-- Page 6 --\nThe headmistress moved to the long table and tapped the runner with one finger. \"Stand there,\" she said. \"Do not fidget.\"\n\nAria took the mark. The quills lifted and found their pace again. The scratching fell into the same slow thud she felt under her ribs.\n\n\"Who told you to keep it sealed?\" the headmistress asked. Her gaze stayed on Aria’s coat.\n\n\"The coachman. Prefect Grey,\" Aria said. She kept her hands where they could see them. \"He wore a silver mask. He never looked at me.\"\n\nOne of the sable figures wrote faster for a beat, then steadied. Another slid an inkwell closer and watched the surface tremble. The quills held to Aria’s rhythm as if tied to it.\n\n\"Good,\" the headmistress said. She lifted a thin silver tray from the sideboard and held it out. \"Place it here. Do not break the seal.\"\n\nAria drew the letter from her coat. The wax caught the candlelight. Blackthorn sprig. Key. Hollow crown. She set it on the tray and let go.\n\n\"Breathe in,\" the headmistress said, not looking at the seal. \"Out.\" She listened. The quills answered. Rain struck the windows in hard bursts, and the room counted Aria instead.\n\n\"Name,\" the headmistress said. \"Full.\"\n\n\"Aria Nightshade,\" Aria said. Her pulse did not jump; the scratches did not either.\n\nThe headmistress nodded once. \"Hold still.\" She angled the tray, weighing the letter without opening it. Down the table, the sable collars dipped as if to agree. The quills kept writing, line on line, matching Aria’s heart without missing a stroke.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

He never looked at me.\"\n\nOne of the sable figures wrote faster for a beat, then steadied. Another slid an inkwell closer and watched the surface tremble. The quills held to Aria’s rhythm as if tied to it.\n\n\"Good,\" the headmistress said. She lifted a thin silver tray from the sideboard and held it out. \"Place it here. Do not break the seal.\"\n\nAria drew the letter from her coat. The wax caught the candlelight. Blackthorn sprig. Key. Hollow crown. She set it on the tray and let go.\n\n\"Breathe in,\" the headmistress said, not looking at the seal. \"Out.\" She listened. The quills answered. Rain struck the windows in hard bursts, and the room counted Aria instead.\n\n\"Name,\" the headmistress said. \"Full.\"\n\n\"Aria Nightshade,\" Aria said. Her pulse did not jump; the scratches did not either.\n\nThe headmistress nodded once. \"Hold still.\" She angled the tray, weighing the letter without opening it. Down the table, the sable collars dipped as if to agree. The quills kept writing, line on line, matching Aria’s heart without missing a stroke.\n-- Page 7 --\nThe headmistress tilted the tray, then set it on a plain block of oak. She slipped a glass bell down over the letter. Breath mist filmed the bell and cleared in slow pulses.\n\n“Did any hand but mine set that seal?” she asked. Her eyes were steady on Aria’s face, not the wax.\n\n“No,” Aria said. “The coachman said you sealed it. I kept it against my coat.” She worked her fingers once, then stilled them.\n\n“Good.” The headmistress drew a thin needle from a leather case. “Your right hand.”\n\nAria offered it without asking why. The prick bit and was done. One dark bead fell, struck the bell’s crown, then slid and kissed the wax through the glass. The quills faltered, then wrote hard in a single sweep. Down the line, Aria watched her name repeat, letters crisp and even.\n\nMorwen eased two steps closer and held out a folded square of linen. Aria took it and pressed her thumb. The sting settled. She kept her chin level.\n\n“Chain is sound,” the headmistress said. She lifted the bell by its knob and listened to the room take Aria’s measure again. “We will open it when the storm breaks the first time.” She looked to the windows. “You will stand witness then, Miss Nightshade. Until that, you do not touch it.”\n\n“When?” Aria asked. She flexed her fingers once under the linen.\n\n“When the clock loses its voice.” The headmistress set the bell back over the letter. The faculty’s quills slowed to a patient tick. “Prefect Grey will keep you until the bell. He will also answer what you earn.” She paused. “Not what you want.”\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

Never reveal internal planning. Make this story easy to read. Progress the scene naturally each turn.\nStyle: Write lean, concrete prose. Prefer plain, contemporary diction; concrete nouns and active verbs.\nSentence architecture: Mostly simple declaratives (avg 12–18 words); avoid semicolons; em dashes sparingly; at most one subordinate clause.\nFigurative discipline: Use at most one fresh, in-world metaphor or simile per page, only if it clarifies mood or action. Do not stack or extend a metaphor. Avoid cosmic/abstract analogies.\nPOV integrity: Any image must be something the viewpoint character would plausibly think or notice.\nLiteral-first: Prefer literal sensory description and specific action beats; reach for comparison only when it makes the moment clearer.\nSelf-edit: Remove mixed/cliché metaphors and decorative modifiers that do not carry weight; prefer literal rephrasings.\nDialogue: Treat talk as action under pressure. Each turn should answer the prior move (answer, qualify, push back, or pivot) and carry its own small aim. Avoid orphaned declarations.\nAdjacency pairs: Close the loop—question→answer (or refusal), claim→challenge, offer→accept/decline.

The quills lifted and found their pace again. The scratching fell into the same slow thud she felt under her ribs.\n\n\"Who told you to keep it sealed?\" the headmistress asked. Her gaze stayed on Aria’s coat.\n\n\"The coachman. Prefect Grey,\" Aria said. She kept her hands where they could see them. \"He wore a silver mask. He never looked at me.\"\n\nOne of the sable figures wrote faster for a beat, then steadied. Another slid an inkwell closer and watched the surface tremble. The quills held to Aria’s rhythm as if tied to it.\n\n\"Good,\" the headmistress said. She lifted a thin silver tray from the sideboard and held it out. \"Place it here. Do not break the seal.\"\n\nAria drew the letter from her coat. The wax caught the candlelight. Blackthorn sprig. Key. Hollow crown. She set it on the tray and let go.\n\n\"Breathe in,\" the headmistress said, not looking at the seal. \"Out.\" She listened. The quills answered. Rain struck the windows in hard bursts, and the room counted Aria instead.\n\n\"Name,\" the headmistress said. \"Full.\"\n\n\"Aria Nightshade,\" Aria said. Her pulse did not jump; the scratches did not either.\n\nThe headmistress nodded once. \"Hold still.\" She angled the tray, weighing the letter without opening it. Down the table, the sable collars dipped as if to agree. The quills kept writing, line on line, matching Aria’s heart without missing a stroke.\n-- Page 7 --\nThe headmistress tilted the tray, then set it on a plain block of oak. She slipped a glass bell down over the letter. Breath mist filmed the bell and cleared in slow pulses.\n\n“Did any hand but mine set that seal?” she asked. Her eyes were steady on Aria’s face, not the wax.\n\n“No,” Aria said. “The coachman said you sealed it. I kept it against my coat.” She worked her fingers once, then stilled them.\n\n“Good.” The headmistress drew a thin needle from a leather case. “Your right hand.”\n\nAria offered it without asking why. The prick bit and was done. One dark bead fell, struck the bell’s crown, then slid and kissed the wax through the glass. The quills faltered, then wrote hard in a single sweep. Down the line, Aria watched her name repeat, letters crisp and even.\n\nMorwen eased two steps closer and held out a folded square of linen. Aria took it and pressed her thumb. The sting settled. She kept her chin level.\n\n“Chain is sound,” the headmistress said. She lifted the bell by its knob and listened to the room take Aria’s measure again. “We will open it when the storm breaks the first time.” She looked to the windows. “You will stand witness then, Miss Nightshade. Until that, you do not touch it.”\n\n“When?” Aria asked. She flexed her fingers once under the linen.\n\n“When the clock loses its voice.” The headmistress set the bell back over the letter. The faculty’s quills slowed to a patient tick. “Prefect Grey will keep you until the bell. He will also answer what you earn.” She paused. “Not what you want.”\n-- Page 8 --\nMorwen touched Aria’s elbow. “With me,” she said, already turning. The sable collars dipped once, then went still again as if the room had shut its eyes.\n\nAria glanced at the glass bell. Her coat felt lighter without the letter. She let that sit and followed Morwen to the door.\n\nThe corridor breathed cold. Lamps hissed and threw thin light along the stone. Somewhere a clock counted the hours in a flat, patient tone.\n\n“You’ll sleep,” Morwen said, voice low. “You’ll eat. You won’t wander. When the bell comes, I’ll fetch you.” She walked like she knew where every loose flag lay.\n\n“What happens if I wander?” Aria asked. She kept her hands at her sides, thumb wrapped in clean linen.\n\n“You meet someone you weren’t ready to meet.” Morwen didn’t look back. “And they learn you.”\n\nThey turned past a window cut into the wall. Rain streamed down the lead like veins. A thin man waited under the arch ahead with a ledger clutched to his chest.\n\n“Archivist,” Morwen said. She slowed but did not yield the lane. “First night, Aria Nightshade.”\n\nHe nodded. His eyes flicked to Aria’s bandaged thumb, then to her face. “I heard them,” he said. “All in one hand.”\n\n“They spelled it right,” Aria said. She let the line fall without a smile.\n\n“Mm.” He uncapped his pen and wrote a neat time. “Dormitory West. Bed four. Keep the curtain closed if you want sleep. The clock fights a losing war on that side.”\n\n“Thank you,” Morwen said. She tipped her head, a small concession. To Aria: “Come.”\n\nThey moved on. The hall bent and dipped.

She slipped a glass bell down over the letter. Breath mist filmed the bell and cleared in slow pulses.\n\n“Did any hand but mine set that seal?” she asked. Her eyes were steady on Aria’s face, not the wax.\n\n“No,” Aria said. “The coachman said you sealed it. I kept it against my coat.” She worked her fingers once, then stilled them.\n\n“Good.” The headmistress drew a thin needle from a leather case. “Your right hand.”\n\nAria offered it without asking why. The prick bit and was done. One dark bead fell, struck the bell’s crown, then slid and kissed the wax through the glass. The quills faltered, then wrote hard in a single sweep. Down the line, Aria watched her name repeat, letters crisp and even.\n\nMorwen eased two steps closer and held out a folded square of linen. Aria took it and pressed her thumb. The sting settled. She kept her chin level.\n\n“Chain is sound,” the headmistress said. She lifted the bell by its knob and listened to the room take Aria’s measure again. “We will open it when the storm breaks the first time.” She looked to the windows. “You will stand witness then, Miss Nightshade. Until that, you do not touch it.”\n\n“When?” Aria asked. She flexed her fingers once under the linen.\n\n“When the clock loses its voice.” The headmistress set the bell back over the letter. The faculty’s quills slowed to a patient tick. “Prefect Grey will keep you until the bell. He will also answer what you earn.” She paused. “Not what you want.”\n-- Page 8 --\nMorwen touched Aria’s elbow. “With me,” she said, already turning. The sable collars dipped once, then went still again as if the room had shut its eyes.\n\nAria glanced at the glass bell. Her coat felt lighter without the letter. She let that sit and followed Morwen to the door.\n\nThe corridor breathed cold. Lamps hissed and threw thin light along the stone. Somewhere a clock counted the hours in a flat, patient tone.\n\n“You’ll sleep,” Morwen said, voice low. “You’ll eat. You won’t wander. When the bell comes, I’ll fetch you.” She walked like she knew where every loose flag lay.\n\n“What happens if I wander?” Aria asked. She kept her hands at her sides, thumb wrapped in clean linen.\n\n“You meet someone you weren’t ready to meet.” Morwen didn’t look back. “And they learn you.”\n\nThey turned past a window cut into the wall. Rain streamed down the lead like veins. A thin man waited under the arch ahead with a ledger clutched to his chest.\n\n“Archivist,” Morwen said. She slowed but did not yield the lane. “First night, Aria Nightshade.”\n\nHe nodded. His eyes flicked to Aria’s bandaged thumb, then to her face. “I heard them,” he said. “All in one hand.”\n\n“They spelled it right,” Aria said. She let the line fall without a smile.\n\n“Mm.” He uncapped his pen and wrote a neat time. “Dormitory West. Bed four. Keep the curtain closed if you want sleep. The clock fights a losing war on that side.”\n\n“Thank you,” Morwen said. She tipped her head, a small concession. To Aria: “Come.”\n\nThey moved on. The hall bent and dipped. Aria counted the steps out of habit and let the storm do the talking for her.\n-- Page 9 --\nThey turned into a narrower run of hall where the lamps burned lower. Morwen’s pace never slackened. Aria matched her steps and watched the rain crawl across the stone slit windows like ink seeking seams.\n\n“Dormitory West,” Morwen said. She drew a key from her sleeve and fit it to a black door banded with iron. The hinges sighed. “Bed four is yours. Curtain closed after lights. If you hear the clock argue with itself, do not answer.”\n\n“What would I say?” Aria asked. She kept her voice even. It felt like the right kind of joke in this place.\n\n“Exactly,” Morwen said. She handed Aria a thin iron tag stamped with a 4. “You earn answers; you don’t collect them. Sleep.” Her eyes checked Aria’s bandaged thumb once, then she stepped back into the hall. “Don’t wander.” The door took her warning with a soft click.\n\nThe dorm smelled of wool and old soap. Narrow beds lined one wall, each with a dark curtain hung from a rail. A long window faced the storm. The clock’s tone came through it thin and stubborn, like a kettle that refused to boil. Bed four waited under the far beam with a small trunk at its foot.\n\nAria set her coat across the mattress and touched the curtain. The cloth was heavy and cool. A stitched tag at the pillow edge read Aria Nightshade in neat black. The ink shone wet at the tail of the e.\n\n“You’re late,” a voice said from bed three, low from behind a half-drawn curtain. A pale hand eased the fabric aside. A girl watched her with quick eyes. “Sabine Holt. Don’t leave your boots out. They migrate.”\n\n“I’ll trap them,” Aria said. She slid her boots under the trunk heel to heel, then checked the tag again without touching it. The storm rattled the window latch once. Somewhere the clock drew breath, lost it, and found it again. Aria pulled her curtain and sat on the bed, listening to the room count her with the rain.\nReturn strictly the JSON format described."}

The sable collars dipped once, then went still again as if the room had shut its eyes.\n\nAria glanced at the glass bell. Her coat felt lighter without the letter. She let that sit and followed Morwen to the door.\n\nThe corridor breathed cold. Lamps hissed and threw thin light along the stone. Somewhere a clock counted the hours in a flat, patient tone.\n\n“You’ll sleep,” Morwen said, voice low. “You’ll eat. You won’t wander. When the bell comes, I’ll fetch you.” She walked like she knew where every loose flag lay.\n\n“What happens if I wander?” Aria asked. She kept her hands at her sides, thumb wrapped in clean linen.\n\n“You meet someone you weren’t ready to meet.” Morwen didn’t look back. “And they learn you.”\n\nThey turned past a window cut into the wall. Rain streamed down the lead like veins. A thin man waited under the arch ahead with a ledger clutched to his chest.\n\n“Archivist,” Morwen said. She slowed but did not yield the lane. “First night, Aria Nightshade.”\n\nHe nodded. His eyes flicked to Aria’s bandaged thumb, then to her face. “I heard them,” he said. “All in one hand.”\n\n“They spelled it right,” Aria said. She let the line fall without a smile.\n\n“Mm.” He uncapped his pen and wrote a neat time. “Dormitory West. Bed four. Keep the curtain closed if you want sleep. The clock fights a losing war on that side.”\n\n“Thank you,” Morwen said. She tipped her head, a small concession. To Aria: “Come.”\n\nThey moved on. The hall bent and dipped. Aria counted the steps out of habit and let the storm do the talking for her.\n-- Page 9 --\nThey turned into a narrower run of hall where the lamps burned lower. Morwen’s pace never slackened. Aria matched her steps and watched the rain crawl across the stone slit windows like ink seeking seams.\n\n“Dormitory West,” Morwen said. She drew a key from her sleeve and fit it to a black door banded with iron. The hinges sighed. “Bed four is yours. Curtain closed after lights. If you hear the clock argue with itself, do not answer.”\n\n“What would I say?” Aria asked. She kept her voice even. It felt like the right kind of joke in this place.\n\n“Exactly,” Morwen said. She handed Aria a thin iron tag stamped with a 4. “You earn answers; you don’t collect them. Sleep.” Her eyes checked Aria’s bandaged thumb once, then she stepped back into the hall. “Don’t wander.” The door took her warning with a soft click.\n\nThe dorm smelled of wool and old soap. Narrow beds lined one wall, each with a dark curtain hung from a rail. A long window faced the storm. The clock’s tone came through it thin and stubborn, like a kettle that refused to boil. Bed four waited under the far beam with a small trunk at its foot.\n\nAria set her coat across the mattress and touched the curtain. The cloth was heavy and cool. A stitched tag at the pillow edge read Aria Nightshade in neat black. The ink shone wet at the tail of the e.\n\n“You’re late,” a voice said from bed three, low from behind a half-drawn curtain. A pale hand eased the fabric aside. A girl watched her with quick eyes. “Sabine Holt. Don’t leave your boots out. They migrate.”\n\n“I’ll trap them,” Aria said. She slid her boots under the trunk heel to heel, then checked the tag again without touching it. The storm rattled the window latch once. Somewhere the clock drew breath, lost it, and found it again. Aria pulled her curtain and sat on the bed, listening to the room count her with the rain.\n-- Page 10 --\nAria tested the mattress with a hand. The ticking felt tight and thin under the sheet. The blanket smelled of sun once and damp now. She set her trunk latch toward the wall and slid the iron tag into the slit cut in the bedpost.\n\nSabine shifted and pushed her curtain wider. A short black braid fell to her shoulder. Her eyes flicked to Aria’s bandaged thumb. “They pricked you already,” she said. “Welcome.”\n\n“They wanted proof I’m me,” Aria said. She eased onto the bed and set her coat folded at her feet. The window hummed as a gust shouldered it. The latch ticked, then held.\n\n“Proof takes blood here.” Sabine drew her knees up and wrapped her arms around them. A small tin sat on her pillow with a roll of mints inside. She flipped the lid and offered one. “Sugar helps the first night.”\n\nAria took one and let it crunch. The sweet cut the taste of old soap. “You said my boots migrate.”\n\n“They walk off to the laundry if you’re careless,” Sabine said. She tilted her chin at the row. “The hooks complain if the floor gets crowded. Also, some girls. They like collections.” She folded her curtain back another inch. “Don’t leave your key where they can see it either.”\n\nA door at the far end clicked. A thin woman in grey stepped in and trimmed the lamps with a brass snuffer. Wicks hissed, and the dorm fell to two low flames. “Curtains at the half. Lights all out on the second bell,” she said.

Aria felt the misstep in her teeth. “What happens when it loses its voice?” she asked, keeping her tone flat.\n\n“Storm takes it,” Sabine said. She rolled the mint along her tongue and watched the window. “Then we listen to something else until they fix it.” She didn’t name it.
